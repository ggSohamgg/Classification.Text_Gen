# ðŸ“˜ Science Text Analyzer

The **Science Text Analyzer** is a dual-purpose deep learning application that:

-  **Classifies academic text** into **Science**, **Mathematics**, or **History**
-  **Generates Scientific content**, especially in **Physics**, **Chemistry**, and **Biology**

Built with **LSTM models** and trained on carefully curated academic datasets, this tool supports **educational research**, **curriculum support**, and **content creation**.

## ðŸš€ How to Use

Simply visit the [Hugging Face Space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/nnsohamnn/Classification.Text_Gen) to use the application directly in your browser. No installation required!

### For Text Classification:
1. Navigate to the "Classify Text" tab
2. Enter or paste your academic text in the input box
3. Click "Classify" to see the predicted subject and confidence score

### For Text Generation:
1. Navigate to the "Generate Text" tab
2. Enter a scientific prompt in the input box
3. Adjust the length (maximum 60 words) and temperature sliders as desired
4. Click "Generate" to create scientific text based on your prompt
- **Note**: Longer generations may take more time to process
