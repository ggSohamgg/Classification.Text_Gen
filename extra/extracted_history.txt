THEMES IN INDIAN HISTORY  P ART II 196 During the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries about per cent of the population of India lived in its villages
Both peasants and landed elites were involved in agricultural production and claimed rights to a share of the produce
This created relationships of cooperation, competition and conflict among them
The sum of these agrarian relationships made up rural society
At the same time agencies from outside also entered into the rural world
Most important among these was the Mughal state, which derived the bulk of its income from agricultural production
Agents of the state – revenue assessors, collectors, record keepers – sought to control rural society so as to ensure that cultivation took place and the state got its regular share of taxes from the produce
Since many crops were grown for sale, trade, money and markets entered the villages and linked the agricultural areas with the towns

Peasants and A gricultur al Production The basic unit of agricultural society was the village, inhabited by peasants who performed the manifold seasonal tasks that made up agricultural production throughout the year – tilling the soil, sowing seeds, harvesting the cr op when it was ripe
Further , they contributed their labour to the production of agro-based goods such as sugar and oil
But rural India was not characterised by settled peasant production alone
Several kinds of areas such as large tracts of dry land or hilly regions were not cultivable in the same way as the more fertileFig

In addition, forest areas made up a substantial pr oportion of territory
W e need to keep this varied topography in mind when discussing agrarian society
1.1 Looking for sources Our understanding of the workings of rural society does not come from those who worked the land, as peasants did not write about themselves
Our major source for the agrarian history of the sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries are chronicles and documents from the Mughal court (see also Chapter 9)
One of the most important chronicles was the Ain-i Akbari (in short the Ain, see also Section 8) authored by Akbar’s court historian Abu’l Fazl
This text meticulously recorded the arrangements made by the state to ensure cultivation, to enable the collection of revenue by the agencies of the state and to regulate the relationship between the state and rural magnates, the zamindars
The central purpose of the Ain was to present a vision of Akbar’s empire where social harmony was provided by a strong ruling class
Any revolt or assertion of autonomous power against the Mughal state was, in the eyes of the author of the Ain, predestined to fail
In other words, whatever we learn from the Ain about peasants remains a view from the top
Fortunately, however , the account of the Ain can be supplemented by descriptions contained in sources emanating from regions away from the Mughal capital
These include detailed revenue records from Gujarat, Maharashtra and Rajasthan dating from the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries
Further , the extensive records of the East India Company (see also Chapter ) provide us with useful descriptions of agrarian relations in eastern India
All these sources record instances of conflicts between peasants, zamindars and the state
In the process they give us an insight into peasants’ perception of and their expectations of fairness from the state
1.2 Peasants and their lands The term which Indo-Persian sources of the Mughal period most frequently used to denote a peasant was raiyat (plural, riaya ) or muzarian
In addition, we also encounter the terms kisan or asami
Sources of the seventeenth century refer to two kinds of peasants – khud-kashta and pahi-kashta
The formerPEASANTS , ZAMINDARS AND THE STATE THEMES IN INDIAN HISTORY  P ART II 198 were residents of the village in which they held their lands
The latter were non-resident cultivators who belonged to some other village, but cultivated lands elsewhere on a contractual basis
People became pahi-kashta either out of choice – for example, when terms of revenue in a distant village were more favourable – or out of compulsion – for example, forced by economic distress after a famine
Seldom did the average peasant of north India possess more than a pair of bullocks and two ploughs; most possessed even less
In Gujarat peasants possessing about six acres of land were considered to be affluent; in Bengal, on the other hand, five acres was the upper limit of an average peasant far m; acres would make one a rich asami
Cultivation was based on the principle of individual ownership
Peasant lands were bought and sold in the same way as the lands of other property owners
This nineteenth-century description of peasant holdings in the Delhi-Agra region would apply equally to the seventeenth century: The cultivating peasants ( asamis ), who plough up the fields, mark the limits of each field, for identification and demarcation, with borders of (raised) earth, brick and thorn so that thousands of such fields may be counted in a village
1.3 Irrigation and technology The abundance of land, available labour and the mobility of peasants were three factors that accounted for the constant expansion of agriculture
Since the primary purpose of agriculture is to feed people, basic staples such as rice, wheat or millets were the most frequently cultivated crops
Areas which received inches or more of rainfall a year were generally rice-producing zones, followed by wheat and millets, corresponding to a descending scale of precipitation
Monsoons remained the backbone of Indian agriculture, as they are even today
But there were crops which r equir ed additional water
Artificial systems of irrigation had to be devised for this.Peasants on the move This was a feature of agrarian society which struck a keen observer lik e Babur , the first Mughal emper or, for cefully enough for him to write about it in the Babur Nama , his memoirs : In Hindustan hamlets and villages, towns indeed, are depopulated and set up in a moment! If the people of a large town, one inhabited for years even, flee from it, they do it in such a way that not a sign or trace of them remains in a day and a half
On the other hand, if they fix their eyes on a place to settle, they need not dig water courses because their crops are all rain-grown, and as the population of Hindustan is unlimited it swarms in
They make a tank or a well; they need not build houses or set up walls khas -grass abounds, wood is unlimited, huts are made, and straightaway there is a village or a town!Source 1 Ü Describe the aspects of agricultural life that struck Babur as particular to regions in northern India
199 Irrigating trees and fields This is an excerpt from the Babur Nama that describes the irrigation devices the emperor observed in northern India: The greater part of Hindustan country is situated on level land
Many though its towns and cultivated lands are, it nowhere has running waters For water is not at all a necessity in cultivating crops and orchards
Autumn crops grow by the downpour of the rains themselves; and strange it is that spring crops grow even when no rains fall
(However) to young trees water is made to flow by means of buckets or wheels In Lahore, Dipalpur (both in present-day Pakistan) and those other parts, people water by means of a wheel
They make two circles of rope long enough to suit the depths of the well, fix strips of wood between them, and on these fasten pitchers
The ropes with the wood and attached pitchers are put over the wheel-well
At one end of the wheel-axle a second wheel is fixed, and close to it another on an upright axle
The last wheel the bullock turns; its teeth catch in the teeth of the second (wheel), and thus the wheel with the pitchers is turned
A trough is set where the water empties from the pitchers and from this the water is conveyed everywhere
In Agra, Chandwar , Bayana (all in pr esent-day Uttar P radesh) and those parts again, people water with a bucket At the well-edge they set up a fork of wood, having a roller adjusted between the forks, tie a rope to a large bucket, put the rope over a r oller, and tie its other end to the bullock
One person must drive the bullock, another empty the bucket.Ü Compare the irrigation devices observed by Babur with what you have learnt about irrigation in Vijayanagara (Chapter 7)
What kind of resources would each of these systems require? Which systems could ensure the participation of peasants in improving agricultural technology? Fig
8.2 A reconstructed Persian wheel, described hereSource 2PEASANTS , ZAMINDARS AND THE STATE THEMES IN INDIAN HISTORY  P ART II 200 Irrigation projects received state support as well
For example, in northern India the state undertook digging of new canals ( nahr, nala) and also r epair ed old ones like the shahnahr in the Punjab during Shah Jahan’s reign
Though agriculture was labour intensive, peasants did use technologies that often harnessed cattle energy
One example was the wooden plough, which was light and easily assembled with an iron tip or coulter
It ther efore did not make deep furr ows, which preserved the moisture better during the intensely hot months
A drill, pulled by a pair of giant oxen, was used to plant seeds, but broadcasting of seed was the most prevalent method
Hoeing and weeding were done simultaneously using a narrow iron blade with a small wooden handle
1.4 An abundance of crops Agriculture was organised around two major seasonal cycles, the kharif (autumn) and the rabi (spring)
This would mean that most regions, except those terrains that were the most arid or inhospitable, produced a minimum of two crops a year ( do-fasla ), whereas some, where rainfall or irrigation assur ed a continuous supply of water , even gave three crops
This ensured an enormous variety of produce
For instance, we are told in the Ain that the Mughal provinces of Agra produced varieties of crops and Delhi produced over the two seasons
Bengal produced varieties of rice alone
However , the focus on the cultivation of basic staples did not mean that agriculture in medieval India was only for subsistence
W e often come acr oss the term jins-i kamil (literally, perfect crops) in our sources
The Mughal state also encouraged peasants to cultivate such crops as they brought in more revenue
Crops such as cotton and sugarcane were jins-i kamil par excellence
Cotton was grown over a great swathe of territory spread over central India and the Deccan plateau, whereas Bengal was famous for its sugar
Such cash cr ops would also include various sorts of oilseeds (for example, mustard) and lentils
This shows how subsistence and commercial production were closely intertwined in an average peasant’s holding
During the seventeenth century several new crops from different parts of the world reached the IndianThe spread of tobacco This plant, which arrived first in the Deccan, spread to northern India in the early years of the seventeenth century
The Ain does not mention tobacco in the lists of crops in northern India
Akbar and his nobles came across tobacco for the first time in 1604
At this time smoking tobacco (in hookahs or chillums ) seems to have caught on in a big way
Jahangir was so concerned about its addiction that he banned it
This was totally ineffective because by the end of the seventeenth century , tobacco had become a major article of consumption, cultivation and trade all over India
Agricultural prosperity and population growth One important outcome of such varied and flexible forms of agricultural production was a slow demographic growth
Despite periodic disruptions caused by famines and epidemics, Indias population increased, according to calculations by economic historians, by about million people between 1600 and 1800, which is an increase of about per cent over 200 years
201 subcontinent
Maize ( makka ), for example, was introduced into India via Africa and Spain and by the seventeenth century it was being listed as one of the major cr ops of wester n India
V egetables like tomatoes, potatoes and chillies were introduced from the New W orld at this time, as wer e fruits like the pineapple and the papaya
2
The Village Community The above account makes it clear that agricultural production involved the intensive participation and initiative of the peasantry
How did this affect the structure of agrarian relations in Mughal society? To find out, let us look at the social groups involved in agricultural expansion, and at their relationships and conflicts
We have seen that peasants held their lands in individual ownership
At the same time they belonged to a collective village community as far as many aspects of their social existence were concerned
There were three constituents of this community – the cultivators, the panchayat, and the village headman ( muqaddam or mandal)
2.1 Caste and the rural milieu Deep inequities on the basis of caste and other caste- like distinctions meant that the cultivators were a highly heterogeneous group
Among those who tilled the land, there was a sizeable number who worked as menials or agricultural labourers ( majur )
Despite the abundance of cultivable land, certain caste groups were assigned menial tasks and thus relegated to poverty
Though there was no census at that time, the little data that we have suggest that such groups comprised a large section of the village population, had the least resources and were constrained by their position in the caste hierarchy, much like the Dalits of modern India
Such distinctions had begun permeating into otherÜ Discuss..

8.3 An early nineteenth-century painting depicting a village in the Punjab Ü Describe what women and men are shown doing in the illustration as well as the architecture of the village
THEMES IN INDIAN HISTORY  P ART II 202 communities too
In Muslim communities menials like the halalkhoran (scavengers) were housed outside the boundaries of the village; similarly the mallahzadas (literally, sons of boatmen) in Bihar were comparable to slaves
There was a direct correlation between caste, poverty and social status at the lower strata of society
Such correlations were not so marked at intermediate levels
In a manual from seventeenth- century Marwar , Rajputs ar e mentioned as peasants, sharing the same space with Jats, who were accorded a lower status in the caste hierarchy
The Gauravas, who cultivated land ar ound V rindavan (Uttar Pradesh), sought Rajput status in the seventeenth century
Castes such as the Ahirs, Gujars and Malis rose in the hierarchy because of the profitability of cattle rearing and horticulture
In the eastern regions, intermediate pastoral and fishing castes like the Sadgops and Kaivartas acquired the status of peasants
2.2 Panchayats and headmen The village panchayat was an assembly of elders, usually important people of the village with hereditary rights over their property
In mixed-caste villages, the panchayat was usually a heterogeneous body
An oligarchy, the panchayat represented various castes and communities in the village, though the village menial-cum-agricultural worker was unlikely to be represented there
The decisions made by these panchayats were binding on the members
The panchayat was headed by a headman known as muqaddam or mandal
Some sources suggest that the headman was chosen through the consensus of the village elders, and that this choice had to be ratified by the zamindar
Headmen held of fice as long as they enjoyed the confidence of the village elders, failing which they could be dismissed by them
The chief function of the headman was to supervise the preparation of village accounts, assisted by the accountant or patwari of the panchayat
The panchayat derived its funds from contributions made by individuals to a common financial pool
These funds were used for defraying the costs of entertaining revenue officials who visited the village from time to time
Expenses for community welfare activities such as tiding overCorrupt mandals The mandals often misused their positions
They were principally accused of defrauding village accounts in connivance with the patwari , and for underassessing the revenue they owed from their own lands in order to pass the additional burden on to the smaller cultivator
203 Fig
8.4 An early nineteenth-century painting depicting a meeting of village elders and tax collectorsnatural calamities (like floods), were also met from these funds
Often these funds were also deployed in construction of a bund or digging a canal which peasants usually could not afford to do on their own
One important function of the panchayat was to ensure that caste boundaries among the various communities inhabiting the village were upheld
In eastern India all marriages were held in the presence of the mandal
In other words one of the duties of the village headman was to oversee the conduct of the members of the village community “chiefly to prevent any offence against their caste”
Panchayats also had the authority to levy fines and inflict more serious forms of punishment like expulsion from the community
The latter was a drastic step and was in most cases meted out for a limited period
It meant that a person forced to leave the village became an outcaste and lost his right to practise his profession
Such a measure was intended as a deterrent to violation of caste norms
In addition to the village panchayat each caste or jati in the village had its own jati panchayat
These panchayats wielded considerable power in rural society
In Rajasthan jati panchayats arbitrated civil disputes between members of different castes
They mediated in contested claims on land, decided whether marriages were performed according to the norms laid down by a particular caste group, determined who had ritual precedence in village functions, and so on
In most cases, except in matters of criminal justice, the state respected the decisions of jati panchayats
Archival records from western India – notably Rajasthan and Maharashtra – contain petitions presented to the panchayat complaining about extortionate taxation or the demand for unpaid labour ( begar ) imposed by the “superior” castes or officials of the state
These petitions were usually made by villagers, from the lowest rungs of rural society
Often petitions were made collectively as PEASANTS , ZAMINDARS AND THE STATE Ü How has the artist differentiated between the village elders and the tax collectors? THEMES IN INDIAN HISTORY  P ART II 204 well, by a caste group or a community protesting against what they considered were morally illegitimate demands on the part of elite groups
These included excessive tax demands which, especially in times of drought or other disasters, endangered the peasants’ subsistence
In the eyes of the petitioners the right to the basic minimum for survival was sanctioned by custom
They regarded the village panchayat as the court of appeal that would ensure that the state carried out its moral obligations and guaranteed justice
The decision of the panchayat in conflicts between “lower -caste” peasants and state officials or the local zamindar could vary from case to case
In cases of excessive revenue demands, the panchayat often suggested compromise
In cases where reconciliation failed, peasants took recourse to more drastic forms of resistance, such as deserting the village
The relatively easy availability of uncultivated land and the competition over labour resources made this an effective weapon in the hands of cultivators
2.3 Village artisans Another interesting aspect of the village was the elaborate relationship of exchange between different producers
Marathi documents and village surveys made in the early years of British rule have revealed the existence of substantial numbers of artisans, sometimes as high as per cent of the total households in the villages
At times, however, the distinction between artisans and peasants in village society was a fluid one, as many groups performed the tasks of both
Cultivators and their families would also participate in craft production – such as dyeing, textile printing, baking and firing of pottery, making and repairing Fig
8.5 A seventeenth-century painting depicting textile production Ü Describe the activities that are shown in the illustration
205 agricultural implements
Phases in the agricultural calendar when there was a relative lull in activity, as between sowing and weeding or between weeding and harvesting, were a time when cultivators could engage in artisanal production
Village artisans – potters, blacksmiths, carpenters, barbers, even goldsmiths – provided specialised services in return for which they were compensated by villagers by a variety of means
The most common way of doing so was by giving them a share of the harvest, or an allotment of land, perhaps cultivable wastes, which was likely to be decided by the panchayat
In Maharashtra such lands became the artisans’ miras or watan – their hereditary holding
Another variant of this was a system where artisans and individual peasant households entered into a mutually negotiated system of remuneration, most of the time goods for services
For example, eighteenth-century records tell us of zamindars in Bengal who remunerated blacksmiths, carpenters, even goldsmiths for their work by paying them “a small daily allowance and diet money”
This later came to be described as the jajmani system, though the term was not in vogue in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries
Such evidence is interesting because it indicates the intricate ways in which exchange networks operated at the micro -level of the village
Cash remuneration was not entir ely unknown either
2.4 A “little republic”? How does one understand the significance of the village community? Some British officials in the nineteenth century saw the village as a “little republic” made up of fraternal partners sharing resour ces and labour in a collective
However , this was not a sign of rural egalitarianism
There was individual ownership of assets and deep inequities based on caste and gender distinctions
A group of powerful individuals decided the affairs of the village, exploited the weaker sections and had the authority to dispense justice
More importantly, a cash nexus had already developed through trade between villages and towns
In the Mughal heartland too, revenue was assessed and collected in cash

W omen in A grarian Socie ty As you may have observed in many different societies, the production process often involves men and women performing certain specified roles
In the contexts that we are exploring, women and men had to work shoulder to shoulder in the fields
Men tilled and ploughed, while women sowed, weeded, threshed and winnowed the harvest
With the growth of nucleated villages and expansion in individuated peasant farming, which characterised medieval Indian agriculture, the basis of production was the labour and resources of the entire household
Naturally, a gendered segregation between the home (for women) and the world (for men) was not possible in this context
Nonetheless biases related to women’s biological functions did continue
Menstruating women, for instance, were not allowed to touch the plough or the potter’s wheel in western India, or enter the groves where betel-leaves ( paan ) were grown in Bengal
Artisanal tasks such as spinning yarn, sifting and kneading clay for pottery, and embroidery were among the many aspects of production dependent on female labour
The mor e commer cialised the pr oduct, the greater the demand on women’s labour to produce it
In fact, peasant and artisan women worked not only in the fields, but even went to the houses of their employers or to the markets if necessary
Women wer e consider ed an important r esour ce in agrarian society also because they were child bearers in a society dependent on labour
At the same time, high mortality rates among women – owing to malnutrition, frequent pregnancies, death during childbirth – often meant a shortage of wives
This led to the emergence of social customs in peasant and artisan communities that were distinct fromMoney in the village The seventeenth-century F rench traveller Jean -Baptiste T avernier found it remarkable that in India a village must be very small indeed if it has not a money- changer called a Shroff

8.6 A shroff at work 207 those prevalent among elite groups
Marriages in many rural communities required the payment of bride-price rather than dowry to the bride’s family
Remarriage was considered legitimate both among divorced and widowed women
The importance attached to women as a reproductive force also meant that the fear of losing control over them was great
According to established social norms, the household was headed by a male
Thus women were kept under strict control by the male members of the family and the community
They could inflict draconian punishments if they suspected infidelity on the part of women
Documents fr om W estern India – Rajasthan, Gujarat and Maharashtra – record petitions sent by women to the village panchayat, seeking redress and justice
Wives protested against the infidelity of their husbands or the neglect of the wife and children by the male head of the household, the grihasthi
While male infidelity was not always punished, the state and “superior” caste groups did intervene when it came to ensuring that the family was adequately provided for
In most cases when women petitioned to the panchayat, their names were excluded from the record: the petitioner was r eferred to as the mother , sister or wife of the male head of the household
Amongst the landed gentry, women had the right to inherit property
Instances from the Punjab show that women, including widows, actively participated in the rural land market as sellers of property inherited by them
Hindu and Muslim women inherited zamindaris which they were free to sell or mortgage
Women zamindars were known in eighteenth-century Bengal
In fact, one of the biggest and most famous of the eighteenth-century zamindaris, that of Rajshahi, had a woman at the helm

F orests and T ribes 4.1 Beyond settled villages There was more to rural India than sedentary agriculture
Apart from the intensively cultivated provinces in northern and north-western India, huge swathes of forests – dense forest ( jangal ) or scrubland ( kharbandi ) – existed all over eastern India, central India, northern India (including the Terai on the Indo-Nepal border), Jharkhand, and in peninsular India down the W ester n Ghats and the Deccan plateau
Though it is nearly impossible to set an all-India average of the forest cover for this period, informed conjectures based on contemporary sources suggest an average of per cent
Forest dwellers were termed jangli in contemporary texts
Being jangli, however , did not mean an absence of “civilisation”, as popular usage of the term today seems to connote
Rather , the ter m described those whose livelihood came from the gathering of forest produce, hunting and shifting agriculture
These activities were largely season specific
Among the Bhils, for example, spring was reserved for collecting forest produce, summer for fishing, the monsoon months for cultivation, and autumn and winter for hunting
Such a sequence presumed and perpetuated mobility, which was a distinctive feature of tribes inhabiting these forests
For the state, the forest was a subversive place – a place of refuge (mawas ) for troublemakers
Once again, we turn to Babur who says that jungles provided a good defence “behind which the people of the pargana become stubbornly rebellious and pay no taxes”
4.2 Inroads into forests External forces entered the forest in different ways
For instance, the state required elephants for the army
So the peshkash levied from forest people often included a supply of elephants.Fig

What is the symbolic element that helps establish the connection between the hunt and ideal justice? 209 In the Mughal political ideology, the hunt symbolised the overwhelming concern of the state to relate to all its subjects, rich and poor
Regular hunting expeditions, so court historians tell us, enabled the emperor to travel across the extensive territories of his empire and personally attend to the grievances of its inhabitants
The hunt was a subject frequently painted by court artists
The painter resorted to the device of inserting a small scene somewhere in the picture that functioned as a symbol of a harmonious reign
Clearance of forests for agricultural settlements This is an excerpt from a sixteenth-century Bengali poem, Chandimangala , composed by Mukundaram Chakrabarti
The hero of the poem, Kalaketu, set up a kingdom by clearing forests: Hearing the news, outsiders came from various lands
Kalaketu then bought and distributed among them Heavy knives, axes, battle-axes and pikes
From the north came the Das (people) One hundred of them advanced

1595 This is how Abul F azl describes the transactions between the hill tribes and the plains in the suba of Awadh (part of present-day Uttar Pradesh): From the northern mountains quantities of goods ar e carried on the backs of men, of stout ponies and of goats, such as gold, copper , lead, musk, tails of the kutas cow (the yak), honey , chuk (an acid composed of orange juice and lemon boiled together), pomegranate seed, ginger , long pepper , majith (a plant producing a red dye) root, borax, zedoary (a root resembling turmeric), wax, woollen stuffs, wooden ware, hawks, falcons, black falcons, merlins (a kind of bird), and other articles
In exchange they carry back white and colour ed cloths, amber , salt, asafoetida, ornaments, glass and earthen ware
The spread of commercial agriculture was an important external factor that impinged on the lives of those who lived in the forests
Forest products – like honey, beeswax and gum lac – were in great demand
Some, such as gum lac, became major items of overseas export from India in the seventeenth century
Elephants were also captured and sold
Trade involved an exchange of commodities thr ough barter as well
Some tribes, like the Loha nis in the Punjab, were engaged in overland trade, between India and Afghanistan, and in the town-country trade in the Punjab itself
Social factors too wrought changes in the lives of forest dwellers
Like the “big men” of the village community, tribes also had their chieftains
Many tribal chiefs had become zamindars, some even became kings
For this they required to build up an army
They recruited people from their lineage groups or demanded that their fraternity provide military service
T ribes in the Sind r egion had ar mies comprising 6,000 cavalry and 7,000 infantry
In Assam, the Ahom kings had their paiks , people who were obliged to render military service in exchange for land

211 Though the transition from a tribal to a monar chical system had started much earlier , the process seems to have become fully developed only by the sixteenth century
This can be seen from the Ain’s observations on the existence of tribal kingdoms in the north-east
W ar was a common occurrence
For instance, the Koch kings fought and subjugated a number of neighbouring tribes in a long sequence of wars through the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries
New cultural influences also began to penetrate into forested zones
Some historians have indeed suggested that sufi saints ( pirs) played a major role in the slow acceptance of Islam among agricultural communities emerging in newly colonised places (see also Chapter 6)
5
The Zamindars Our story of agrarian relations in Mughal India will not be complete without referring to a class of people in the countryside that lived off agriculture but did not participate directly in the processes of agricultural production
These were the zamindars who were landed proprietors who also enjoyed certain social and economic privileges by virtue of their superior status in rural society
Caste was one factor that accounted for the elevated status of zamindars; another factor was that they performed certain services ( khidmat ) for the state
The zamindars held extensive personal lands termed milkiyat, meaning property
Milkiyat lands were cultivated for the private use of zamindars, often with the help of hir ed or servile labour
The zamindars could sell, bequeath or mortgage these lands at will
Zamindars also derived their power from the fact that they could often collect revenue on behalf of the state, a service for which they were compensated financially
Control over military resources was another sour ce of power
Most zamindars had fortresses ( qilachas ) as well as an armed contingent comprising units of cavalry, artillery and infantry
Thus if we visualise social relations in the Mughal countryside as a pyramid, zamindars clearly constituted its very narrow apex

It also reflects a fairly large representation from the so-called intermediate castes, as we saw earlier , as well as a liberal sprinkling of Muslim zamindaris
Contemporary documents give an impression that conquest may have been the source of the origin of some zamindaris
The dispossession of weaker people by a powerful military chieftain was quite often a way of expanding a zamindari
It is, however , unlikely that the state would have allowed such a show of aggression by a zamindar unless he had been confirmed by an imperial order ( sana d)
More important were the slow processes of zamindari consolidation, which are also documented in sources
These involved colonisation of new lands, by transfer of rights, by order of the state and by purchase
These were the processes which perhaps permitted people belonging to the relatively “lower” castes to enter the rank of zamindars as zamindaris were bought and sold quite briskly in this period
A combination of factors also allowed the consolidation of clan- or lineage-based zamindaris
For example, the Rajputs and Jats adopted these strategies to consolidate their control over vast swathes of territory in northern India
Likewise, peasant-pastoralists (like the Sadgops) carved out powerful zamindaris in areas of central and south- western Bengal
Zamindars spearheaded the colonisation of agricultural land, and helped in settling cultivators by providing them with the means of cultivation, including cash loans
The buying and selling of zamindaris accelerated the process of monetisation in the countryside
In addition, zamindars sold the produce from their milkiyat lands
There is evidence to show that zamindars often established markets ( haats ) to which peasants also came to sell their produce
Although there can be little doubt that zamindars were an exploitative class, their relationship with the peasantry had an element of reciprocity, paternalism and patronage
Two aspects reinforce this view
First, the bhakti saints, who eloquently condemned caste-based and other forms of oppression (see also Chapter 6), did not portray the zamindars (or , interestingly, the moneylender) as exploiters or oppressors of the peasantry
Usually it was theA parallel army! According to the Ain, the combined military strength of the zamindars in Mughal India was 384,558 cavalry , 4,277,057 infantry , 1,863 elephants, 4,260 cannons, and 4,500 boats
213 revenue official of the state who was the object of their ire
Second, in a large number of agrarian uprisings which erupted in north India in the seventeenth century, zamindars often received the support of the peasantry in their struggle against the state
6
Land Revenue System Revenue from the land was the economic mainstay of the Mughal Empire
It was therefore vital for the state to create an administrative apparatus to ensure control over agricultural production, and to fix and collect revenue from across the length and breadth of the rapidly expanding empire
This apparatus included the office ( daftar ) of the diwan who was responsible for supervising the fiscal system of the empire
Thus revenue officials and record keepers penetrated the agricultural domain and became a decisive agent in shaping agrarian relations
The Mughal state tried to first acquire specific information about the extent of the agricultural lands in the empire and what these lands produced before fixing the burden of taxes on people
The land revenue arrangements consisted of two stages – first, assessment and then actual collection
The jama was the amount assessed, as opposed to hasil, the amount collected
In his list of duties of the amil-guzar or r evenue collector , Akbar decr eed that while he should strive to make cultivators pay in cash, the option of payment in kind was also to be kept open
While fixing revenue, the attempt of the state was to maximise its claims
The scope of actually r ealising these claims was, however , sometimes thwarted by local conditions
Both cultivated and cultivable lands were measured in each province
The Ain compiled the aggregates of such lands during Akbar’s rule
Efforts to measure lands continued under subsequent emperors
For instance, in 1665, Aurangzeb expressly instructed his revenue officials to prepare annual records of the number of cultivators in each village (Sour ce 7)
Y et not all areas were measured successfully
As we have seen, forests covered huge areas of the subcontinent and thus remained unmeasured.Ü Discuss..

Polaj is land which is annually cultivated for each crop in succession and is never allowed to lie fallow
Parauti is land left out of cultivation for a time that it may recover its strength
Chachar is land that has lain fallow for three or four years
Banjar is land uncultivated for five years and more
Of the first two kinds of land, there are three classes, good, middling, and bad
They add together the produce of each sort, and the third of this represents the medium produce, one-third part of which is exacted as the Royal dues
The mansabdari system The Mughal administrative system had at its apex a military- cum-bureaucratic apparatus (mansabdari ) which was responsible for looking after the civil and military affairs of the state
Some mansabdars were paid in cash ( naqdi), while the majority of them were paid through assignments of revenue (jagirs ) in different regions of the empire
They were transferred periodically

The Flo w of Sil ver The Mughal Empire was among the large territorial empires in Asia that had managed to consolidate power and resources during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries

An expanding trade brought in huge amounts of silver bullion into Asia to pay for goods procured from India, and a large part of that bullion gravitated towards India
This was good for India as it did not have natural r esour ces of silver
As a r esult, the period between the sixteenth and eighteenth centuries was also marked by a remarkable stability in the availability of metal currency, particularly the silver rupya in India
This facilitated an unprecedented expansion of minting of coins and the circulation of money in the economy as well as the ability of the Mughal state to extract taxes and revenue in cash
The testimony of an Italian traveller , Giovanni Careri, who passed through India c
1690, provides a graphic account about the way silver travelled across the globe to reach India
It also gives us an idea of the phenomenal amounts of cash and commodity transactions in seventeenth-century India

The Ain-i Akbari of Abul Fazl Allami The Ain-i Akbari was the culmination of a large historical, administrative project of classification undertaken by Abu’l Fazl at the order of Emperor Akbar
It was completed in 1598, the forty-second regnal year of the emper or, after having gone thr ough five revisions
The Ain was part of a larger project of history writing commissioned by Akbar
This history, known as the Akbar Nama, comprised three books
The first two provided a historical narrative
We will look at these parts mor e closely in Chapter 9
The Ain-i Akbari , the third book, was organised as a compendium of imperial regulations and a gazetteer of the empire
The Ain gives detailed accounts of the organisation of the court, administration and army, the sources of revenue and the physical layout of the provinces of Akbar’s empire and the literary, cultural and religious traditions of the people
Along with a description of the various departments of Akbar’s government and elaborate descriptions of thePEASANTS , ZAMINDARS AND THE STATE THEMES IN INDIAN HISTORY  P ART II 218 various provinces ( subas ) of the empire, the Ain gives us intricate quantitative information of those provinces
Collecting and compiling this information systematically was an important imperial exercise
It informed the emperor about the varied and diverse customs and practices prevailing across his extensive territories
The Ain is therefore a mine of information for us about the Mughal Empire during Akbar’s r eign
It is important, however , to keep in mind that this is a view of the regions from the centre, a view of society from its apex
The Ain is made up of five books ( daftars ), of which the first three books describe the administration
The first book, called manzil-abadi , concerns the imperial household and its maintenance
The second book, sipah-abadi , covers the military and civil administration and the establishment of servants
This book includes notices and short biographical sketches of imperial officials ( mansabdars ), learned men, poets and artists
The third book, mulk-abadi , is the one which deals with the fiscal side of the empire and provides rich quantitative information on revenue rates, followed by the “Account of the Twelve Provinces”
This section has detailed statistical information, which includes the geographic, topographic and economic profile of all subas and their administrative and fiscal divisions ( sarkars , parganas and mahals ), total measured area, and assessed revenue (jama)
After setting out details at the suba level, the Ain goes on to give a detailed picture of the sarkars below the suba
This it does in the form of tables, which have eight columns giving the following information: (1) parganat /mahal ; (2) qila (forts); (3) arazi and zamin-i paimuda (measured area); (4) naqdi, revenue assessed in cash; (5) suyurghal , grants of revenue in charity; (6) zamindars ; columns 7 and 8 contain details of the castes of these zamindars , and their troops including their horsemen ( sawar ), foot-soldiers (piyada ) and elephants ( fil)
The mulk-abadi gives a fascinating, detailed and highly complex view of agrarian society in northern India
The fourth and fifth books ( daftars ) deal with the religious, literary and cultural traditions of the people of India and also contain a collection of Akbar’s “auspicious sayings”.Fig

Abu’l Fazl presenting the manuscript of the completed Akbar Nama to his patron 219 Source 9 Moistening the rose garden of fortune In this e xtract Abul F azl gives a vivid account of how and fr om whom he collected his information: ..
to Abul F azl, son of Mubarak this sublime mandate was given
Write with the pen of sincerity the account of the glorious events and of our dominion -conquering victories Assur edly, I spent much labour and research in collecting the records and narratives of His Majestys actions and I was a long time interrogating the servants of the State and the old members of the illustrious family
I examined both prudent, truth-speaking old men and active-minded, right- actioned young ones and reduced their statements to writing
The Royal commands were issued to the provinces, that those who from old service remembered, with certainty or with adminicle of doubt, the events of the past, should copy out the notes and memoranda and transit them to the court
(Then) a second command shone forth from the holy Presence-chamber; to wit  that the materials which had been collected should be ..
recited in the royal hearing, and whatever might have to be written down afterwards, should be introduced into the noble volume as a supplement, and that such details as on account of the minuteness of the inquiries and the minutae of affairs, (which) could not then be brought to an end, should be inserted afterwards at my leisure
Being relieved by this royal order  the interpreter of the Divine ordinance  from the secret anxiety of my heart, I proceeded to reduce into writing the rough draughts (drafts)which were void of the grace of arrangement and style
I obtained the chronicle of events beginning at the Nineteenth Y ear of the Divine Era, when the Record Office was established by the enlightened intellect of His Majesty , and fr om its rich pages, I gather ed the accounts of many events
Great pains too, were taken to procure the originals or copies of most of the orders which had been issued to the provinces from the Accession up to the present-day I also took much trouble to incorporate many of the reports which ministers and high officials had submitted, about the affairs of the empire and the events of foreign countries
And my labour-loving soul was satiated by the apparatus of inquiry and research
I also exerted myself energetically to collect the rough notes and memoranda of sagacious and well-informed men
By these means, I constructed a reservoir for irrigating and moistening the rose garden of fortune (the Akbar Nama )
Ü List all the sources that Abu’l Fazl used to compile his work
Which of these sources would have been most useful for arriving at an understanding of agrarian relations? To what extent do you think his work would have been influenced by his relationship with Akbar?PEASANTS , ZAMINDARS AND THE STATE THEMES IN INDIAN HISTORY  P ART II 220 Although the Ain was officially sponsored to record detailed information to facilitate Emperor Akbar govern his empire, it was much more than a reproduction of official papers
That the manuscript was revised five times by the author would suggest a high degree of caution on the part of Abu’l Fazl and a search for authenticity
For instance, oral testimonies were cross-checked and verified before being incorporated as “facts” in the chronicle
In the quantitative sections, all numeric data were reproduced in words so as to minimise the chances of subsequent transcriptional errors
Historians who have carefully studied the Ain point out that it is not without its problems
Numerous errors in totalling have been detected
These are ascribed to simple slips of arithmetic or of transcription by Abu’l Fazl’s assistants
These are generally minor and do not detract from the overall quantitative veracity of the manuals
Another limitation of the Ain is the somewhat skewed nature of the quantitative data
Data were not collected uniformly from all provinces
For instance, while for many subas detailed information was compiled about the caste composition of the zamindars, such information is not available for Bengal and Orissa
Further , while the fiscal data from the subas is remarkable for its richness, some equally vital parameters such as prices and wages from these same areas are not as well documented
The detailed list of prices and wages that the Ain does provide is mainly derived from data pertaining to areas in or around the imperial capital of Agra, and is therefore of limited relevance for the rest of the country
These limitations notwithstanding, the Ain remains an extraordinary document of its times
By providing fascinating glimpses into the structure and organisation of the Mughal Empire and by giving us quantitative information about its products and people, Abu’l Fazl achieved a major breakthrough in the tradition of medieval chroniclers who wrote mostly about remarkable political events – wars, conquests, political machinations, and dynastic turmoil
Information about the country, its peopleTranslating the Ain Given the importance of the Ain, it has been translated for use by a number of scholars
Henry Blochmann edited it and the Asiatic Society of Bengal, Calcutta (present-day Kolkata), published it in its Bibliotheca Indica series
The book has also been translated into English in three volumes
The standard translation of V olume 1 is that of Henry Blochmann (Calcutta 1873)
The other two volumes were translated by H.S
Jarrett (Calcutta 1891 and 1894)
221 and its products was mentioned only incidentally and as embellishments to the essentially political thrust of the narrative
The Ain completely departed from this tradition as it recorded information about the empire and the people of India, and thus constitutes a benchmark for studying India at the turn of the seventeenth century
The value of the Ain’s quantitative evidence is uncontested where the study of agrarian relations is concerned
But it is the information it contains on people, their professions and trades and on the imperial establishment and the grandees of the empire which enables historians to reconstruct the social fabric of India at that time.PEASANTS , ZAMINDARS AND THE STATE Timeline Landmarks in the History of the Mughal Empire 1526 Babur defeats Ibrahim Lodi, the Delhi Sultan, at Panipat, becomes the first Mughal emperor 1530- First phase of Humayun’s reign 1540- Humayun defeated by Sher Shah, in exile at the Safavid court 1555- Humayun regains lost territories 1556 -1605 Reign of Akbar 1605- Reign of Jahangir 1628- Reign of Shah Jahan 1658 -1707 Reign of Aurangzeb 1739 Nadir Shah invades India and sacks Delhi 1761 Ahmad Shah Abdali defeats the Marathas in the third battle of Panipat 1765 The diwani of Bengal transferred to the East India Company 1857 Last Mughal ruler , Bahadur Shah II, deposed by the British and exiled to Rangoon (present day Y angon, Myanmar) THEMES IN INDIAN HISTORY  P ART II 222 Answ er in1 -150 w ords 1.What are the problems in using the Ain as a source for reconstructing agrarian history?

fourteenth to sixteenth century)
fourteenth to sixteenth century) Vijayanagara or “city of victory” was the name of both a city and an empire
The empire was founded in the fourteenth century
In its heyday it stretched from the river Krishna in the north to the extreme south of the peninsula
In 1565 the city was sacked and subsequently deserted
Although it fell into ruin in the seventeenth-eighteenth centuries, it lived on in the memories of people living in the Krishna-Tungabhadra doab
They remembered it as Hampi, a name derived from that of the local mother goddess, Pampadevi
These oral traditions combined with archaeological finds, monuments and inscriptions and other records helped scholars to rediscover the Vijayanagara Empire
1
The Disco very of Ham pi The ruins at Hampi were brought to light in 1800 by an engineer and antiquarian named Colonel Colin Mackenzie
An employee of the English East India Company, he prepared the first survey map of the site
Much of the initial information he received was based on the memories of priests of the Virupaksha temple and the shrine of Pampadevi
Subsequently, from 1856, photographers began to record the monuments which enabled scholars to study them
As early as 1836 epigraphists began collecting several dozen inscriptions found at this and other temples at Hampi
In an effort to reconstruct the history of the city and the empire, historians collated information from these sources with accounts of foreign travellers and other literature written in Telugu, Kannada, Tamil and Sanskrit.Fig
7.1 A part of the stone wall that was built around the city of VijayanagaraTHEME SEVEN 171 Colin Mackenzie Born in 1754, Colin Mackenzie became famous as an engineer , surveyor and cartographer
In 1815 he was appointed the first Surveyor General of India, a post he held till his death in 1821
He embarked on collecting local histories and surveying historic sites in order to better understand Indias past and make governance of the colony easier
He says that it struggled long under the miseries of bad management before the South came under the benign influence of the British government
By studying Vijayanagara, Mackenzie believed that the East India Company could gain much useful information on many of these institutions, laws and customs whose influence still prevails among the various T ribes of Natives forming the general mass of the population to this day

Ray as, Nay akas and Sult ans According to tradition and epigraphic evidence two brothers, Harihara and Bukka, founded the Vijayanagara Empire in 1336
This empire included within its fluctuating frontiers peoples who spoke different languages and followed different religious traditions
On their norther n frontier , the V ijayanagara kings competed with contemporary rulers – including the Sultans of the Deccan and the Gajapati rulers of Orissa – for control of the fertile river valleys and the resources generated by lucrative overseas trade
At the same time, interaction between these states led to sharing of ideas, especially in the field of architecture
The rulers of Vijayanagara borrowed concepts and building techniques which they then developed further .Fig

Ruling elites in these areas had extended patronage to elaborate temples such as the Brihadishvara temple at Thanjavur and the Chennakeshava temple at Belur
The rulers of Vijayanagara, who called themselves rayas , built on these traditions and carried them, as we will see, literally to new heights
2.1 Kings and traders As warfare during these times depended upon effective cavalry, the import of horses from Arabia and Central Asia was very important for rival kingdoms
This trade was initially controlled by Arab traders
Local communities of merchants known as kudirai chettis or horse merchants also participated in these exchanges
From 1498 other actors appeared on the scene
These were the Portuguese, who arrived on the west coast of the subcontinent and attempted to establish trading and military stations
Their superior military technology, especially the use of muskets, enabled them to become important players in the tangled politics of the period
In fact, Vijayanagara was also noted for its markets dealing in spices, textiles and precious stones
T rade was often r egarded as a status symbol for such cities, which boasted of a wealthy population that demanded high-value exotic goods, especially precious stones and jewellery
The revenue derivedFig
7.3 The gopuram or gateway of the Brihadishvara temple at Thanjavur Elephants, horses and men Gajapati literally means lord of elephants
This was the name of a ruling lineage that was very powerful in Orissa in the fifteenth century
In the popular traditions of Vijayanagara the Deccan Sultans are termed as ashvapati or lord of horses and the rayas are called narapati or lord of men
173 Kings and traders Krishnadeva Raya (ruled 1509-), the most famous ruler of Vijayanagara, composed a work on statecraft in T elugu known as the Amuktamalyada
About traders he wrote: A king should improve the harbours of his country and so encourage its commerce that horses, elephants, precious gems, sandalwood, pearls and other articles are freely imported He should arrange that the foreign sailors who land in his country on account of storms, illness and exhaustion are looked after in a suitable manner Make the merchants of distant foreign countries who import elephants and good horses be attached to yourself by providing them with daily audience, presents and allowing decent profits
Then those articles will never go to your enemies.from trade in turn contributed significantly to the prosperity of the state
2.2 The apogee and decline of the empire Within the polity, claimants to power included members of the ruling lineage as well as military commanders
The first dynasty, known as the Sangama dynasty, exercised control till 1485
They were supplanted by the Saluvas, military commanders, who remained in power till 1503 when they were replaced by the Tuluvas
Krishnadeva Raya belonged to the Tuluva dynasty
Krishnadeva Raya’s rule was characterised by expansion and consolidation
This was the time when the land between the Tungabhadra and Krishna rivers (the Raichur doab) was acquired (1512), the rulers of Orissa were subdued (1514) and severe defeats were inflicted on the Sultan of Bijapur (1520)
Although the kingdom remained in a constant state of military preparedness, it flourished under conditions of unparalleled peace and prosperity
Krishnadeva Raya is credited with building some fine temples and adding impressive gopurams to many important south Indian temples
He also founded a suburban township near Vijayanagara called Nagalapuram after his mother
Some of the most detailed descriptions of Vijayanagara come from his time or just after
Strain began to show within the imperial structure following Krishnadeva Raya’s death in 1529
His successors were troubled by rebellious nayakas or military chiefs
By 1542 control at the centre had shifted to another ruling lineage, that of the Aravidu, which remained in power till the end of the seventeenth century
During this period, as indeed earlier , the military ambitions of the rulers of Vijayanagara as well as those of the Deccan Sultanates resulted in shifting alignments
Eventually this led to an alliance of the Sultanates against Vijayanagara
In 1565 Rama Raya, the chief minister of Vijayanagara, led the army into battle at Rakshasi-Tangadi (also known as Talikota), where his forces were routed by the combined armies of Bijapur , Ahmadnagar and Golconda
The victorious armies sacked the city of Vijayanagara
The city was totally abandoned within a few years

Although the armies of the Sultans were responsible for the destruction of the city of Vijayanagara, relations between the Sultans and the rayas were not always or inevitably hostile, in spite of religious differences
Krishnadeva Raya, for example, supported some claimants to power in the Sultanates and took pride in the title “establisher of the Y avana kingdom”
Similarly, the Sultan of Bijapur intervened to resolve succession disputes in Vijayanagara following the death of Krishnadeva Raya
In fact the Vijayanagara kings were keen to ensure the stability of the Sultanates and vice versa
It was the adventurous policy of Rama Raya who tried to play off one Sultan against another that led the Sultans to combine together and decisively defeat him.Map 1 South India, c

These chiefs often moved from one ar ea to another , and in many cases wer e accompanied by peasants looking for fertile land on which to settle
These chiefs were known as nayakas and they usually spoke Telugu or Kannada
Many nayakas submitted to the authority of the kings of Vijayanagara but they often rebelled and had to be subdued by military action
The amara-nayaka system was a major political innovation of the Vijayanagara Empire
It is likely that many features of this system were derived from the iqta system of the Delhi Sultanate
The amara-nayakas were military commanders who were given territories to govern by the raya
They collected taxes and other dues from peasants, craftspersons and traders in the area
They retained part of the revenue for personal use and for maintaining a stipulated contingent of horses and elephants
These contingents provided the Vijayanagara kings with an effective fighting force with which they brought the entire southern peninsula under their control
Some of the revenue was also used for the maintenance of temples and irrigation works
The amara-nayakas sent tribute to the king annually and personally appeared in the royal court with gifts to express their loyalty
Kings occasionally asserted their control over them by transferring them from one place to another
However , during the course of the seventeenth century, many of these nayakas established independent kingdoms
This hastened the collapse of the central imperial structure

Why do you think the gardens and water bodies were selected for special mention by Paes?A sprawling city This is an excerpt from Domingo Paess description of Vijayanagara: The size of this city I do not write here, because it cannot all be seen from any one spot, but I climbed a hill whence I could see a great part of it; I could not see it all because it lies between several ranges of hills
What I saw from thence seemed to me as large as Rome, and very beautiful to the sight; there are many groves of trees within it, in the gardens of the houses, and many conduits of water which flow into the midst of it, and in places there are lakes; and the king has close to his palace a palm-grove and other rich fruit-bearing trees.Source 3Finding out about the city A large number of inscriptions of the kings of Vijayanagara and their nayakas recording donations to temples as well as describing important events have been recovered
Several travellers visited the city and wrote about it
Notable among their accounts are those of an Italian trader named Nicolo de Conti, an ambassador named Abdur Razzaq sent by the ruler of Persia, a merchant named Afanasii Nikitin from Russia, all of whom visited the city in the fifteenth century , and those of Duarte Barbosa, Domingo Paes and F ernao Nuniz fr om Portugal, who came in the sixteenth century
177 3.1 W ater r esour ces The most striking feature about the location of Vijayanagara is the natural basin formed by the river Tungabhadra which flows in a north-easterly direction
The surrounding landscape is characterised by stunning granite hills that seem to form a girdle around the city
A number of streams flow down to the river from these rocky outcrops
In almost all cases embankments were built along these streams to create reservoirs of varying sizes
As this is one of the most arid zones of the peninsula, elaborate arrangements had to be made to store rainwater and conduct it to the city
The most important such tank was built in the early years of the fifteenth century and is now called Kamalapuram tank
W ater fr om this tank not only irrigated fields nearby but was also conducted through a channel to the “royal centre”
One of the most prominent waterworks to be seen among the ruins is the Hiriya canal
This canal drew water from a dam across the Tungabhadra and irrigated the cultivated valley that separated the “sacred centre” from the “urban core”
This was apparently built by kings of the Sangama dynasty
3.2 Fortifications and roads Before we examine the different parts of the city in detail let us look at what enclosed them all – the great fortress walls
Abdur Razzaq, an ambassador sent by the ruler of Persia to Calicut (present-day Kozhikode) in the fifteenth century, was greatly impressed by the fortifications, and mentioned seven lines of forts
These encircled not only the city but also its agricultural hinterland and forests
The outermost wall linked the hills surrounding the city
The massive masonry construction was slightly tapered
No mortar or cementing agent was employed anywhere in the construction
The stone blocks were wedge shaped, which held them in place, and the inner portion of the walls was of earth packed with rubble
Square or rectangular bastions projected outwards
What was most significant about this fortification is that it enclosed agricultural tracts
Abdur Razzaq noted tha t“between the first, second and the third walls there are cultivated fields, gardens and houses”
And Paes observed: “From this first circuit until youFig
7.5 An aqueduct leading into the royal centreHow tanks were built About a tank constructed by Krishnadeva Raya, Paes wrote: The king made a tank at the mouth of two hills so that all the water which comes from either one side or the other collects there; and, besides this, water comes to it from more than three leagues (approximately kilometres) by pipes which run along the lower parts of the range outside
This water is brought from a lake which itself overflows into a little river
The tank has thr ee large pillars handsomely carved with figures; these connect above with certain pipes by which they get water when they have to irrigate their gardens and rice-fields
In order to make this tank the said king broke down a hill In the tank I saw so many people at work that there must have been fifteen or twenty thousand men, looking like ants Source 4 AN IMPERIAL CAPITAL: VIJAYANAG ARA THEMES IN INDIAN HISTORY  P ART II 178 enter the city there is a great distance, in which are fields in which they sow rice and have many gardens and much water , in which water comes fr om two lakes.” These statements have been corroborated by present-day archaeologists, who have also found evidence of an agricultural tract between the sacred centre and the urban core
This tract was serviced by an elaborate canal system drawing water from the Tungabhadra
Why do you think agricultural tracts were incorporated within the fortified area? Often, the objective of medieval sieges was to starve the defenders into submission
These sieges could last for several months and sometimes even years
Normally rulers tried to be prepared for such situations by building large granaries within fortified areas
The rulers of Vijayanagara adopted a more expensive and elaborate strategy of protecting the agricultural belt itself
A second line of fortification went round the inner core of the urban complex, and a third line surrounded the royal centre, within which each set of major buildings was surrounded by its own high walls
The fort was entered through well-guarded gates, which linked the city to the major roads
Gateways were distinctive architectural features that often defined the structures to which they regulated access
The arch on the gateway leading into the fortified settlement as well as the dome over the gate (Fig
7.6) are regarded as typical features of the architecture introduced by the Turkish Sultans
Art historians refer to this style as Indo-Islamic, as it grew continually through interaction with local building practices in different regions
Archaeologists have studied roads within the city and those leading out from it
These have been identified by tracing paths through gateways, as well as by finds of pavements
Roads generally wound around through the valleys, avoiding rocky terrain
Some of the most important roads extended from temple gateways, and were lined by bazaars
3.3 The urban core Moving along the roads leading into the urban core, there is relatively little archaeological evidence of the houses of ordinary people
Archaeologists haveFig

This was also the Muslim residential quarter
Tombs and mosques located here have distinctive functions, yet their architecture resembles that of the mandapas found in the temples of Hampi
This is how the sixteenth-century Portuguese traveller Barbosa described the houses of ordinary people, which have not survived: “The other houses of the people are thatched, but nonetheless well built and arranged according to occupations, in long streets with many open places.” Field surveys indicate that the entire area was dotted with numerous shrines and small temples, pointing to the prevalence of a variety of cults, perhaps supported by different communities
The surveys also indicate that wells, rainwater tanks as well as temple tanks may have served as sources of water to the ordinary town dwellers

The R oyal Centr e The royal centre was located in the south-western part of the settlement
Although designated as a royal centre, it included over temples
Clearly, the patronage of temples and cults was important for rulers who were trying to establish and legitimise their authority through association with the divinities housed in the shrines

One difference between these structures and temples is that the latter were constructed entirely of masonry, while the superstructure of the secular buildings was made of perishable materials
4.1 The mahanavami dibba Some of the more distinctive structures in the area have been assigned names based on the form of the buildings as well as their functions
The “king’s palace” is the largest of the enclosures but has not yielded definitive evidence of being a royal residence
It has two of the most impressive platforms, usually called the “audience hall” and the “mahanavami dibba”
The entire complex is surrounded by high double walls with a street running between them
The audience hall is a high platform with slots for wooden pillars at close and regular intervals
It had a stair case going up to the second floor , which r ested on these pillars
The pillars being closely spaced, would have left little free space and thus it is not clear what the hall was used for
Located on one of the highest points in the city, the “ mahanavami dibba” is a massive platform rising from a base of about ,000 sq
ft to a height of ft
There is evidence that it supported a wooden structure
The base of the platform is covered with relief carvings (Fig
7.)
Rituals associated with the structure probably coincided with Mahanavami (literally, the great ninth day) of the ten-day Hindu festival during the autumn months of September and October , known variously as Dusehra (northern India), Durga Puja (in Bengal)Fig
7
The mahanavami dibbaA House of Victory?

Carvings on the mahanavami dibba Ü Can you identify the themes of the carvings? 181 and Navaratri or Mahanavami (in peninsular India)
The Vijayanagara kings displayed their prestige, power and suzerainty on this occasion
The ceremonies performed on the occasion included worship of the image, worship of the state horse, and the sacrifice of buffaloes and other animals
Dances, wrestling matches, and processions of caparisoned horses, elephants and chariots and soldiers, as well as ritual presentations before the king and his guests by the chief nayakas and subordinate kings marked the occasion
These ceremonies were imbued with deep symbolic meanings
On the last day of the festival the king inspected his army and the armies of the nayakas in a grand ceremony in an open field
On this occasion the nayakas brought rich gifts for the king as well as the stipulated tribute
Was the “ mahanavami dibba” that stands today the centre of this elaborate ritual? Scholars have pointed out that the space surrounding the structure does not seem to have been adequate for elaborate processions of armed men, women, and large numbers of animals
Like some of the other structures in the royal centre, it remains an enigma
4.2 Other buildings in the royal centre One of the most beautiful buildings in the royal centre is the Lotus Mahal, so named by British travellers in the nineteenth century
While the name is certainly romantic, historians are not quite sureFig

The images in the central shrine ar e missing; however , sculpted panels on the walls survive

The Sacred Centre 5.1 Choosing a capital We now move to the r ocky norther n end of the city on the banks of the Tungabhadra
According to local tradition, these hills sheltered the monkey kingdom of Vali and Sugriva mentioned in the Ramayana
Other traditions suggest that Pampadevi, the local mother goddess, did penance in these hills in order to marry Virupaksha, the guardian deity of the kingdom, also recognised as a form of Shiva
To this day this marriage is celebrated annually in the Virupaksha temple
Among these hills are found Jaina temples of the pre-Vijayanagara period as well
In other words, this area was associated with several sacred traditions
Temple building in the region had a long history, going back to dynasties such as the Pallavas, Chalukyas, Hoysalas and Cholas
Rulers very often encouraged temple building as a means of associating themselves with the divine – often, the deity was explicitly or implicitly identified with the king
Temples also functioned as centres of learning
Besides, rulers and others often granted land and other resources for the maintenance of temples
Consequently, temples developed as significant religious, social, cultural and economic centres
From the point of view of the rulers, constructing, repairing and maintaining temples were important means of winning support and r ecognition for their power , wealth and piety
It is likely that the very choice of the site of Vijayanagara was inspired by the existence of the shrines of Virupaksha and Pampadevi
In fact the Vijayanagara kings claimed to rule on behalf of the god Virupaksha
All royal orders were signed “Shri Virupaksha”, usually in the Kannada script
Rulers also indicated their close links with the gods by using the title “Hindu Suratrana ”
This was a Sanskritisation of the Arabic term Sultan, meaning king, so it literally meant Hindu Sultan
Even as they drew on earlier traditions, the rulers of Vijayanagara innovated and developed these
Royal portrait sculpture was now displayed in temples, and the king’s visits to temples were treated as important state occasions on which he was accompanied by the important nayakas of the empire
185 5.2
Gopurams and mandapas In terms of temple architecture, by this period certain new features were in evidence
These included structures of immense scale that must have been a mark of imperial authority, best exemplified by the raya gopurams (Fig
7.7) or royal gateways that often dwarfed the towers on the central shrines, and signalled the presence of the temple from a great Fig

They were also probably meant as reminders of the power of kings, able to command the resources, techniques and skills needed to construct these towering gateways
Other distinctive features include mandapas or pavilions and long, pillared corridors that often ran around the shrines within the temple complex
Let us look at two temples more closely – the Virupaksha temple and the Vitthala temple
The Virupaksha temple was built over centuries
While inscriptions suggest that the earliest shrine dated to the ninth-tenth centuries, it was substantially enlarged with the establishment of the Vijayanagara Empire
The hall in front of the main shrine was built by Krishnadeva Raya to mark his accession
This was decorated with delicately carved pillars
He is also credited withFig

These additions meant that the central shrine came to occupy a relatively small part of the complex
The halls in the temple were used for a variety of purposes
Some were spaces in which the images of gods were placed to witness special programmes of music, dance, drama, etc
Others were used to celebrate the marriages of deities, and yet others were meant for the deities to swing in
Special images, distinct from those kept in the small central shrine, were used on these occasions

Here, the principal deity was Vitthala, a form of Vishnu generally worshipped in Maharashtra
The introduction of the worship of the deity in Karnataka is another indication of the ways in which the rulers of Vijayanagara drew on different traditions to create an imperial culture
As in the case of other temples, this temple too has several halls and a unique shrine designed as a chariot (Fig
7.2 4)
A characteristic feature of the temple complexes is the chariot streets that extended from the temple gopuram in a straight line
These streets were paved with stone slabs and lined with pillared pavilions in which merchants set up their shops
Just as the nayakas continued with and elaborated on traditions of fortification, so they did with traditions of temple building
In fact, some of the most spectacular gopurams were also built by the local nayakas

How and why did the rulers of Vijayanagara adopt and adapt earlier traditions of ritual architecture? 6
Plo tting P alaces, T emples and Bazaars We have been examining a wealth of infor mation on Vijayanagara – photographs, plans, elevations of structures and sculpture
How was all of this produced? After the initial surveys by Mackenzie, information was pieced together from travellers’ accounts and inscriptions
Through the twentieth century, the site was preserved by the Archaeological Survey of India and the Karnataka Department of Archaeology and Museums
In 1976, Hampi was recognised as a site of national importance
Then, in the early 1980s, an important project was launched to document the material remains at Vijayanagara in detail, through extensive and intensive surveys, using a variety of recording techniques
Over nearly twenty years, dozens ofFig

Let us look at just one part of this enormous exercise – mapping – in more detail
The first step was to divide the entire area into a set of squares, each designated by a letter of the alphabet
Then, each of the small squares was subdivided into a set of even smaller squares
But this was not all: each of these smaller squares was further subdivided into yet smaller units
As you can see, these detailed surveys have been extremely painstaking, and have recovered and documented traces of thousands of structures – from tiny shrines and residences to elaborate temples
They have also led to the recovery of traces of roads, paths, bazaars, etc

Mor e generally , he described the city as being the best- provided city in the world with the markets stocked with provisions such as rice, wheat, grains, India corn and a certain amount of barley and beans, moong, pulses and horse-gram all of which were cheaply and abundantly available
A ccor ding to F ernao Nuniz, the Vijayanagara markets were overflowing with abundance of fruits, grapes and oranges, limes, pomegranates, jackfruit and mangoes and all very cheap
Meat too was sold in abundance in the marketplaces

Would they hurry past the sculptur e, or would they pause to see, reflect and try and understand its complicated symbolism? And what did the people who worked on these colossal construction projects think of the enterprises to which they had contributed their labour? While rulers took all important decisions about the buildings to be constructed, the site, the material to be used and the style to be followed, who possessed the specialised knowledge required for such enormous enterprises? Who drew up the plans for the buildings? Where did the masons, stonecutters, sculptors who did the actual building come from? Were they captur ed during war fr om neighbouring regions? What kind of wages did they get? Who supervised the building activity? How was building material transported and where did it come from? These are some of the questions that we cannot answer by merely looking at the buildings or their remains

Vijayanagara (The New Cambridge History of India Vol.1, P art 2)
Foundation Books, New Delhi.AN IMPERIAL CAPITAL: VIJAYANAG ARA THEMES IN INDIAN HISTORY  P ART II 140 We saw in Chapter 4 that by the mid-first millennium CE the landscape of the subcontinent was dotted with a variety of religious structures – stupas , monasteries, temples
If these typified certain religious beliefs and practices, others have been reconstructed from textual traditions, including the Puranas , many of which received their present shape around the same time, and yet others remain only faintly visible in textual and visual records
New textual sources available from this period include compositions attributed to poet-saints, most of whom expressed themselves orally in regional languages used by ordinary people
These compositions, which were often set to music, were compiled by disciples or devotees, generally after the death of the poet-saint
What is more, these traditions were fluid – generations of devotees tended to elaborate on the original message, and occasionally modified or even abandoned some of the ideas that appeared problematic or irrelevant in different political, social or cultural contexts
Using these sources thus poses a challenge to historians
Historians also draw on hagiographies or biographies of saints written by their followers (or members of their religious sect)
These may not be literally accurate, but allow a glimpse into the ways in which devotees perceived the lives of these path- breaking women and men
As we will see, these sources provide us with insights into a scenario characterised by dynamism and diversity
Let us look at some elements of these more closely.Bhakt i-Suf i Traditions Changes in Religious Beliefs and Changes in Religious Beliefs andChanges in Religious Beliefs and Changes in Religious Beliefs andChanges in Religious Beliefs and De DeDe DeDev vvo oo ootional T tional Ttional T tional Ttional T e ee eexts xtsxts xtsxts ( (( ((c cc cc

6.1 A twelfth-century bronze sculpture of Manikkavachakar , a devotee of Shiva who composed beautiful devotional songs in Tamil THEME SIX 141 Great and little traditions The terms great and little traditions were coined by a sociologist named Robert Redfield in the twentieth century to describe the cultural practices of peasant societies
He found that peasants observed rituals and customs that emanated from dominant social categories, including priests and rulers
These he classified as part of a great tradition
At the same time, peasants also followed local practices that did not necessarily correspond with those of the great tradition
These he included within the category of little tradition
He also noticed that both great and little traditions changed over time, through a process of interaction
While scholars accept the significance of these categories and processes, they are often uncomfortable with the hierarchy suggested by the terms great and little
The use of quotation marks for great and little is one way of indicating this.1
A Mosaic of R eligious Belief s and Practices Perhaps the most striking feature of this phase is the increasing visibility of a wide range of gods and goddesses in sculpture as well as in texts
At one level, this indicates the continued and even extended worship of the major deities – Vishnu, Shiva and the goddess – each of whom was visualised in a variety of forms
1.1 The integration of cults Historians who have tried to understand these developments suggest that there were at least two processes at work
One was a process of disseminating Brahmanical ideas
This is exemplified by the composition, compilation and preservation of Puranic texts in simple Sanskrit verse, explicitly meant to be accessible to women and Shudras, who were generally excluded fr om V edic lear ning
At the same time, there was a second process at work – that of the Brahmanas accepting and reworking the beliefs and practices of these and other social categories
In fact, many beliefs and practices were shaped through a continuous dialogue between what sociologists have described as “great” Sanskritic Puranic traditions and “little” traditions throughout the land
One of the most striking examples of this process is evident at Puri, Orissa, where the principal deity was identified, by the twelfth century, as Jagannatha (literally, the lord of the world), a form of Vishnu
Fig
6.2 Jagannatha (extreme right) with his sister Subhadra (centre) and his brother Balarama (left)BHAKT I-SUFI TRADITIONS THEMES IN INDIAN HISTORY  P ART II 142 If you compare Fig

(Chapter 4) you will notice that the deity is represented in a very different way
In this instance, a local deity, whose image was and continues to be made of wood by local tribal specialists, was recognised as a form of Vishnu
At the same time, Vishnu was visualised in a way that was very different from that in other parts of the country
Such instances of integration are evident amongst goddess cults as well
W orship of the goddess, often simply in the form of a stone smeared with ochre, was evidently widespread
These local deities were often incorporated within the Puranic framework by providing them with an identity as a wife of the principal male deities – sometimes they were equated with Lakshmi, the wife of Vishnu, in other instances, with Parvati, the wife of Shiva
1.2 Difference and conflict Often associated with the goddess were forms of worship that were classified as Tantric
Tantric practices were widespread in several parts of the subcontinent – they were open to women and men, and practitioners often ignored differences of caste and class within the ritual context
Many of these ideas influenced Shaivism as well as Buddhism, especially in the eastern, northern and southern parts of the subcontinent
All of these somewhat divergent and even disparate beliefs and practices would come to be classified as Hindu over the course of the next millennium
The diver gence is per haps most stark if we compar e Vedic and Puranic traditions
The principal deities of the Vedic pantheon, Agni, Indra and Soma, become marginal figures, rarely visible in textual or visual representations
And while we can catch a glimpse of Vishnu, Shiva and the goddess in V edic mantras, these have little in common with the elaborate Puranic mythologies
However , in spite of these obvious discr epancies, the V edas continued to be revered as authoritative
Not surprisingly, there were sometimes conflicts as well – those who valued the V edic tradition often condemned practices that went beyond the closely regulated contact with the divine through the performance of sacrifices or precisely chanted mantras
On the other hand those engaged in Tantric practicesFig
6.3 Sculpture of a Buddhist goddess, Marichi (c.tenth century, Bihar), an example of the process of integration of different religious beliefs and practices 143 frequently ignor ed the authority of the V edas
Also, devotees often tended to project their chosen deity, either Vishnu or Shiva, as supreme
Relations with other traditions, such as Buddhism or Jainism, were also often fraught with tension if not open conflict
The traditions of devotion or bhakti need to be located within this context
Devotional worship had a long history of almost a thousand years before the period we are considering
During this time, expressions of devotion ranged from the routine worship of deities within temples to ecstatic adoration where devotees attained a trance-like state
The singing and chanting of devotional compositions was often a part of such modes of worship
This was particularly true of the V aishnava and Shaiva sects
2
P oems of Pr ayer Ear ly Traditions of Bhakti In the course of the evolution of these forms of worship, in many instances, poet-saints emerged as leaders around whom there developed a community of devotees
Further , while Brahmanas remained important intermediaries between gods and devotees in several forms of bhakti, these traditions also accommodated and acknowledged women and the “lower castes”, categories considered ineligible for liberation within the orthodox Brahmanical framework
What also characterised traditions of bhakti was a remarkable diversity
At a different level, historians of religion often classify bhakti traditions into two broad categories: saguna (with attributes) and nirguna (without attributes)
The former included traditions that focused on the worship of specific deities such as Shiva, Vishnu and his avatars (incarnations) and forms of the goddess or Devi, all often conceptualised in anthropomorphic forms
Nirguna bhakti on the other hand was worship of an abstract form of god
2.1 The Alvars and Nayanars of Tamil Nadu Some of the earliest bhakti movements ( c
sixth century) were led by the Alvars (literally, those who are “immersed” in devotion to Vishnu) and Nayanars (literally, leaders who were devotees of Shiva)
They travelled from place to place singing hymns in Tamil in praise of their gods.Ü Discuss..

V ery often lar ge temples wer e later built at these sacred places
These developed as centres of pilgrimage
Singing compositions of these poet-saints became part of temple rituals in these shrines , as did worship of the saints’ images
2.2 Attitudes towards caste Some historians suggest that the Alvars and Nayanars initiated a movement of protest against the caste system and the dominance of Brahmanas or at least attempted to reform the system
To some extent this is corroborated by the fact that bhaktas hailed from diverse social backgrounds ranging from Brahmanas to artisans and cultivators and even from castes considered “untouchable”
The importance of the traditions of the Alvars and Nayanars was sometimes indicated by the claim that their compositions were as important as the V edas
For instance, one of the major anthologies of compositions by the Alvars, the Nalayira Divyaprabandham, was frequently described as the Tamil V eda, thus claiming that the text was as significant as the four V edas in Sanskrit that wer e cherished by the Brahmanas
2.3 W omen devotees Perhaps one of the most striking features of these traditions was the presence of women
For instance, the compositions of Andal, a woman Alvar , were widely sung (and continue to be sung to date)
Andal saw herself as the beloved of Vishnu; her verses express her love for the deity
Another woman, Karaikkal Ammaiyar , a devotee of Shiva, adopted the path of extreme asceticism in order to attain Compilations of devotional literature By the tenth century the compositions of the Alvars were compiled in an anthology known as the Nalayira Divyaprabandham (Four Thousand Sacred Compositions)
The poems of Appar , Sambandar and Sundarar form the Tevaram , a collection that was compiled and classified in the tenth century on the basis of the music of the songs.Source 1 Source 2The chaturvedin (Brahmana versed in the four V edas) and the outcaste This is an excerpt from a composition of an Alvar named Tondaradippodi, who was a Brahmana: You (Vishnu) manifestly lik e those servants who express their love for your feet, though they may be born outcastes, more than the Chaturvedins who are strangers and without allegiance to your service
Ü Do you think Tondaradippodi was opposed to the caste system? Shastras or devotion?

Ü List the ways in which Karaikkal Ammaiyar depicts herself as presenting a contrast to traditional notions of feminine beauty
2.4 Relations with the state We saw in Chapter 2 that ther e wer e several important chiefdoms in the Tamil region in the early first millennium CE
From the second half of the first millennium there is evidence for states, including those of the Pallavas and Pandyas ( c
sixth to ninth centuries CE)
While Buddhism and Jainism had been prevalent in this region for several centuries, drawing support from merchant and artisan communities, these religious traditions received occasional royal patronage
Interestingly, one of the major themes in Tamil bhakti hymns is the poets’ opposition to Buddhism and Jainism
This is particularly marked in the THEMES IN INDIAN HISTORY  P ART II 146 compositions of the Nayanars
Historians have attempted to explain this hostility by suggesting that it was due to competition between members of other religious traditions for royal patronage
What is evident is that the powerful Chola rulers (ninth to thirteenth centuries) supported Brahmanical and bhakti traditions, making land grants and constructing temples for Vishnu and Shiva
In fact, some of the most magnificent Shiva temples, including those at Chidambaram, Thanjavur and Gangaikondacholapuram, were constructed under the patronage of Chola rulers
This was also the period when some of the most spectacular representations of Shiva in bronze sculpture were produced
Clearly, the visions of the Nayanars inspired artists
Both Nayanars and Alvars were revered by the Vellala peasants
Not surprisingly, rulers tried to win their support as well
The Chola kings, for instance, often attempted to claim divine support and proclaim their own power and status by building splendid temples that were adorned with stone and metal sculpture to recreate the visions of these popular saints who sang in the language of the people
These kings also introduced the singing of Tamil Shaiva hymns in the temples under royal patronage, taking the initiative to collect and organise them into a text ( Tevaram )
Further , inscriptional evidence fr om around 945 suggests that the Chola ruler Parantaka I had consecrated metal images of Appar , Sambandar and Sundarar in a Shiva temple
These were carried in processions during the festivals of these saints.Fig

The V irashaiv a Tradition in K arnat aka The twelfth century witnessed the emergence of a new movement in Karnataka, led by a Brahmana named Basavanna (1106-) who was a minister in the court of a Kalachuri ruler
His followers were known as Virashaivas (heroes of Shiva) or Lingayats (wearers of the linga)
Lingayats continue to be an important community in the region to date
They worship Shiva in his manifestation as a linga , and men usually wear a small linga in a silver case on a loop strung over the left shoulder
Those who ar e revered include the jangama or wandering monks
Lingayats believe that on death the devotee will be united with Shiva and will not return to this world
Therefore they do not practise funerary rites such as cremation, prescribed in the Dharmashastras
Instead, they ceremonially bury their dead
The Lingayats challenged the idea of caste and the “pollution” attributed to certain groups by Brahmanas
They also questioned the theory of rebirth
These won them followers amongst those who were marginalised within the Brahmanical social or der
The Lingayats also encouraged certain practices disapproved in the Dharmashastras, such as post-puberty marriage and the remarriage of widows
Our understanding of the Virashaiva tradition is derived from vachanas (literally, sayings) composed in Kannada by women and men who joined the movement
New religious developments This period also witnessed two major developments
On the one hand , many ideas of the T amil bhaktas (especially the V aishnavas) wer e incorporated within the Sanskritic tradition, culminating in the composition of one of the best-known Puranas, the Bhagavata Purana
Second, we find the development of traditions of bhakti in Maharashtra in the thirteenth century
THEMES IN INDIAN HISTORY  P ART II 148 4
Religious Ferment in North India During the same period, in north India deities such as Vishnu and Shiva were worshipped in temples, often built with the support of rulers
However , historians have not found evidence of anything resembling the compositions of the Alvars and Nayanars till the fourteenth century
How do we account for this difference? Some historians point out that in north India this was the period when several Rajput states emerged
In most of these states Brahmanas occupied positions of importance, performing a range of secular and ritual functions
There seems to have been little or no attempt to challenge their position directly
At the same time other religious leaders, who did not function within the orthodox Brahmanical framework, were gaining ground
These included the Naths, Jogis and Siddhas
Many of them came from artisanal groups, including weavers, who were becoming increasingly important with the development of organised craft production
Demand for such production grew with the emergence of new urban centres, and long-distance trade with Central Asia and W est Asia
Many of these new religious leaders questioned the authority of the V edas, and expressed themselves in languages spoken by ordinary people, which developed over centuries into the ones used today
However , in spite of their popularity these religious leaders were not in a position to win the support of the ruling elites
A new element in this situation was the coming of the Turks which culminated in the establishment of the Delhi Sultanate (thirteenth century)
This undermined the power of many of the Rajput states and the Brahmanas who were associated with these kingdoms
This was accompanied by marked changes in the realm of culture and religion
The coming of the sufis (Section 6) was a significant part of these developments
Fig
6.6 Fragment of a page from the Qur’an, belonging to a manuscript dating to the eighth or ninth century 149 Ulama (plural of alim, or one who knows) are scholars of Islamic studies
As preservers of this tradition they perform various religious, juridical and teaching functions.5
N ew S trands in t he F abr ic Islamic Traditions Just as the regions within the subcontinent were not isolated fr om one another , so too, contact with lands beyond the seas and mountains had existed for millennia
Arab merchants, for instance, frequented ports along the western coast in the first millennium CE, while Central Asian people settled in the north-western parts of the subcontinent during the same period
From the seventh century, with the advent of Islam, these regions became part of what is often termed the Islamic world
5.1 Faiths of rulers and subjects One axis of understanding the significance of these connections that is frequently adopted is to focus on the religions of ruling elites
In 711 an Arab general named Muhammad Qasim conquered Sind, which became part of the Caliph’s domain
Later ( c
thirteenth century) the Turks and Afghans established the Delhi Sultanate
This was followed by the formation of Sultanates in the Deccan and other parts of the subcontinent; Islam was an acknowledged religion of rulers in several areas
This continued with the establishment of the Mughal Empire in the sixteenth century as well as in many of the regional states that emerged in the eighteenth century
Theor etically, Muslim rulers were to be guided by the ulama, who were expected to ensure that they ruled according to the shari‘a
Clearly, the situation was complicated in the subcontinent, where there were populations that did not subscribe to Islam
It is in this context that the category of the zimmi, meaning protected (derived from the Arabic word zimma , protection) developed for people who followed revealed scriptures, such as the Jews and Christians, and lived under Muslim rulership
They paid a tax called jizya and gained the right to be protected by Muslims
In India this status was extended to Hindus as well
As you will see (Chapter 9), rulers such as the Mughals came to regard themselves as emperors of not just Muslims but of all peoples
In effect, rulers often adopted a fairly flexible policy towards their subjects
For instance, several rulers gave land endowments and granted tax exemptions to Hindu, Jaina, Zoroastrian, Christian and Jewish religious institutions and also expressed respect andSharia The sharia is the law governing the Muslim community
It is based on the Quran and the hadis , traditions of the Prophet including a record of his remembered words and deeds
With the expansion of Islamic rule outside Arabia, in areas where customs and traditions were different, qiyas (reasoning by analogy) and ijma (consensus of the community) were recognised as two other sources of legislation
Thus, the sharia evolved from the Quran, hadis , qiyas and ijma.BHAKT I-SUFI TRADITIONS THEMES IN INDIAN HISTORY  P ART II 150 Fig

It is necessary that the order of the Emperor should be obeyed in every way
Reverence for the Jogi Here is an excerpt from a letter written by Aurangzeb to a Jogi in 1661-: The possessor of the sublime station, Shiv Murat, Guru Anand Nath Jio! May your Reverence remain in peace and happiness ever under the protection of Sri Shiv Jio! A piece of cloth for the cloak and a sum of twenty five rupees which have been sent as an offering will reach (Y our R ever ence) Y our R ever ence may write to us whenever there is any service which can be rendered by us
151 5.2 The popular practice of Islam The developments that followed the coming of Islam were not confined to ruling elites; in fact they permeated far and wide, through the subcontinent, amongst different social strata – peasants, artisans, warriors, merchants, to name a few
All those who adopted Islam accepted, in principle, the five “pillars” of the faith: that there is one God, Allah, and Prophet Muhammad is his messenger ( shahada ); offering prayers five times a day ( namaz/sala t); giving alms (zaka t); fasting during the month of Ramzan ( sawm); and performing the pilgrimage to Mecca ( hajj)
However , these universal featur es wer e often overlaid with diversities in practice derived from sectarian affiliations (Sunni, Shi‘a), and the influence of local customary practices of converts from different social milieus
For example, the Khojahs, a branch of the Ismailis (a Shi‘a sect), developed new modes of communication, disseminating ideas derived from the Qur’an through indigenous literary genres
These included the ginan (derived from the Sanskrit jnana , meaning “knowledge”), devotional poems in Punjabi, Multani, Sindhi, Kachchi, Hindi and Gujarati, sung in special ragas during daily prayer meetings
Elsewhere, Arab Muslim traders who settled along the Malabar coast (Kerala) adopted the local language, Malayalam
They also adopted local customs such as matriliny (Chapter 3) and matrilocal residence
The complex blend of a universal faith with local traditions is perhaps best exemplified in the architecture of mosques
Some architectural features Fig

However , ther e are several featur es that show variations – such as roofs and building materials (see Figs
6.9, 6
and 6.)
5.3 Names for communities We often take the ter ms Hindu and Muslim for granted, as labels for religious communities
Y et, these terms did not gain currency for a very long time
Historians who have studied Sanskrit texts and inscriptions dating between the eighth and fourteenth centuries point out that the term musalman or Muslim was virtually never used
Instead, people were occasionally identified in terms of the region from which they came
So, the Turkish rulers were designated as Turushka, Tajika were people from Tajikistan and Parashika were people from Persia
Sometimes, terms used for other peoples were applied to the new migrants
For instance, the Turks and Afghans were referred to as Shakas (Chapters 2 and 3) and Yavanas (a ter m used for Gr eeks)
A more general term for these migrant communities was mlechchha , indicating that they did not observe the norms of caste society and spoke languages that were not derived from Sanskrit
Such terms sometimes had a derogatory connotation, but they rarely denoted a distinct religious community of Muslims in opposition to Hindus
And as we saw (Chapter 5), the term “Hindu” was used in a variety of ways, not necessarily restricted to a religious connotation

The Gr owth of Suf ism In the early centuries of Islam a group of religious- minded people called sufis turned to asceticism and mysticism in protest against the growing materialism of the Caliphate as a religious and political institution
They were critical of the dogmatic definitions and scholastic methods of interpreting the Qur’an and sunna (traditions of the Prophet) adopted by theologians
Instead, they laid emphasis on seeking salvation through intense devotion and love for God by following His commands, and by following the example of the Prophet Muhammad whom they regarded as a perfect human being
The sufis thus sought an interpretation of the Qur’an on the basis of their personal experience
6.1 Khanqahs and silsilas By the eleventh century Sufism evolved into a well- developed movement with a body of literature on Quranic studies and sufi practices
Institutionally, the sufis began to organise communities around the hospice or khanqah (Persian) controlled by a teaching master known as shaikh (in Arabic), pir or murshid (in Persian)
He enrolled disciples ( murids ) and appointed a successor ( khalifa )
He established rules for spiritual conduct and interaction between inmates as well as between laypersons and the master
Sufi silsila s began to crystallise in different parts of the Islamic world around the twelfth century
The word silsila literally means a chain, signifying a continuous link between master and disciple, stretching as an unbroken spiritual genealogy to the Prophet Muhammad
It was through this channel that spiritual power and blessings were transmitted to devotees
Special rituals of initiation were developed in which initiates took an oath of allegiance, wore a patched garment, and shaved their hair
When the shaikh died, his tomb-shrine ( dargah, a Persian term meaning court) became the centre of devotion for his followers
This encouraged the practice of pilgrimage or ziyarat to his grave, particularly on his death anniversary or urs (or marriage, signifying the union of his soul with God)
This was because people believed that in death saints were united with God, and were thus closer to Him than when living
People sought their blessings to attain material and spiritual benefits
Thus evolved the cult of the shaikh revered as wali.Sufism and tasawwuf Sufism is an English word coined in the nineteenth century
The wor d used for Sufism in Islamic texts is tasawwuf
Historians have understood this term in several ways
According to some scholars, it is derived from suf, meaning wool, referring to the coarse woollen clothes worn by sufis
Others derive it from safa, meaning purity
It may also have been derived from suffa, the platform outside the Prophets mosque, where a group of close followers assembled to learn about the faith
Names of silsilas Most sufi lineages were named after a founding figure
For example, the Qadiri order was named after Shaikh Abdul Qadir Jilani
However , some lik e the Chishti order, were named after the ir place of origin, in this case the town of Chisht in central Afghanistan.BHAKT I-SUFI TRADITIONS THEMES IN INDIAN HISTORY  P ART II 154 6.2 Outside the khanqah Some mystics initiated movements based on a radical interpretation of sufi ideals
Many scorned the khanqah and took to mendicancy and observed celibacy
They ignored rituals and observed extreme forms of asceticism
They were known by different names – Qalandars, Madaris, Malangs, Haidaris, etc
Because of their deliberate defiance of the shari‘a they were often referred to as be-shari‘ a, in contrast to the ba-shari‘a sufis who complied with it

The Chishtis in t he Subcontinent Of the groups of sufis who migrated to India in the late twelfth century, the Chishtis were the most influential
This was because they adapted successfully to the local environment and adopted several features of Indian devotional traditions
7.1 Life in the Chishti khanqah The khanqah was the centr e of social life
W e know about Shaikh Nizamuddin’s hospice ( c
fourteenth century) on the banks of the river Y amuna in Ghiyaspur , on the outskirts of what was then the city of Delhi
It comprised several small rooms and a big hall (jama’at khana ) where the inmates and visitors lived and prayed
The inmates included family members of the Shaikh, his attendants and disciples
The Shaikh lived in a small room on the roof of the hall where he met visitors in the morning and evening
A veranda surrounded the courtyard, and a boundary wall ran around the complex
On one occasion, fearing a Mongol invasion, people from the neighbouring areas flocked into the khanqah to seek refuge.Wali (plural auliya ) or friend of God was a sufi who claimed proximity to Allah, acquiring His Grace ( barakat ) to perform miracles ( karamat )

From morning till late night people from all walks of life – soldiers, slaves, singers, merchants, poets, travellers, rich and poor, Hindu jogis (yogi) and qalandars – came seeking discipleship, amulets for healing, and the intercession of the Shaikh in various matters
Other visitors included poets such as Amir Hasan Sijzi and Amir Khusrau and the court historian Ziyauddin Barani, all of whom wrote about the Shaikh
Practices that were adopted, including bowing before the Shaikh, offering water to visitors, shaving the heads of initiates, and yogic exercises, represented attempts to assimilate local traditions
Shaikh Nizamuddin appointed several spiritual successors and deputed them to set up hospices in various parts of the subcontinent
As a result the teachings, practices and organisation of the Chishtis as well as the fame of the Shaikh spread rapidly
This in turn drew pilgrims to his shrine, and also to the shrines of his spiritual ancestors
7.2 Chishti devotionalism: ziyarat and qawwali Pilgrimage, called ziyarat, to tombs of sufi saints is prevalent all over the Muslim world
This practice is an occasion for seeking the sufi’s spiritual grace (barakat )
For more than seven centuries people of various creeds, classes and social backgrounds have expressed their devotion at the dargahs of the five great Chishti saints (see chart on p.154)
Amongst these, the most revered shrine is that of Khwaja Muinuddin, popularly known as “Gharib Nawaz” (comforter of the poor)
The earliest textual references to Khwaja Muinuddin’s dargah date to the fourteenth century
It was evidently popular because of the austerity and piety of its Shaikh, the greatness of his spiritual successors, and the patronage of royal visitors
Muhammad bin Tughlaq ( ruled, 1324-) was theThe story of Data Ganj Bakhsh In 1039 Abul Hasan al Hujwiri, a native of Hujwir near Ghazni in Afghanistan, was forced to cross the Indus as a captive of the invading T urkish army

The grandson of Sultan Mahmud of Ghazni constructed a tomb over his grave, and this tomb-shrine became a site of pilgrimage for his devotees, especially on his death anniversary
Even today Hujwiri is revered as Data Ganj Bakhsh or Giver who bestows treasures and his mausoleum is called Data Darbar or Court of the Giver

Since the shrine was located on the trade route linking Delhi and Gujarat, it attracted a lot of travellers
By the sixteenth century the shrine had become very popular; in fact it was the spirited singing of pilgrims bound for Ajmer that inspired Akbar to visit the tomb
He went there fourteen times, sometimes two or thr ee times a year , to seek blessings for new conquests, fulfilment of vows, and the birth of sons
He maintained this tradition until 1580
Each of these visits was celebrated by generous gifts, which were recorded in imperial documents
For example , in 1568 he offered a huge cauldron ( degh ) to facilitate cooking for pilgrims
He also had a mosque constructed within the compound of the dargah

157 The pilgrimage of the Mughal princess Jahanara, 1643 The following is an excerpt from Jahanaras biography of Shaikh Muinuddin Chishti, titled Munis al Arwah (The Confidant of Spirits): After praising the one God this lowly faqira (humble soul ) Jahanara ..
went from the capital Agra in the company of my great father (Emperor Shah Jahan) towards the pure region of incomparable Ajmer I was committed to this idea, that every day in every station I would perform two cycles of optional prayer For several days ..
I did not sleep on a leopard skin at night, I did not extend my feet in the direction of the blessed sanctuary of the r evered saving master , and I did not turn my back towards him
I passed the days beneath the trees
On Thursday , the fourth of the blessed month of Ramzan, I attained the happiness of pilgrimage to the illuminated and the perfumed tomb With an hour of daylight remaining, I went to the holy sanctuary and rubbed my pale face with the dust of that threshold
From the doorway to the blessed tomb I went bar efoot, kissing the ground
Having entered the dome, I went around the light-filled tomb of my master seven times Finally , with my own hand I put the finest quality of itar on the perfumed tomb of the revered one, and having taken off the rose scarf that I had on my head, I placed it on the top of the blessed tomb ..
Also part of ziyarat is the use of music and dance including mystical chants performed by specially trained musicians or qawwals to evoke divine ecstasy
The sufis remember God either by reciting the zikr (the Divine Names) or evoking His Presence through sama ‘ (literally, “audition”) or performance of mystical music
Sama‘ was integral to the Chishtis, and exemplified interaction with indigenous devotional traditions.Ü What are the gestures that Jahanara records to indicate her devotion to the Shaikh ? How does she suggest that the dargah was a special place?The lamp of the entire land Each sufi shrine was associated with distinctive features

In Delhi, those associated with the Chishti silsila conversed in Hindavi, the language of the people
Other sufis such as Baba Farid composed verses in the local language, which were incorporated in the Guru Granth Sahib
Yet others composed long poems or masnavis to express ideas of divine love using human love as an allegory
For example, the prem-akhyan (love story) Padmavat composed by Malik Muhammad Jayasi revolved around the romance of Padmini and Ratansen, the king of Chittor
Their trials wer e symbolic of the soul’s journey to the divine
Such poetic compositions were often recited in hospices, usually during sama‘
A different genre of sufi poetry was composed in and ar ound the town of Bijapur , Kar nataka
These were short poems in Dakhani (a variant of Urdu) attributed to Chishti sufis who lived in this region during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries
These poems were probably sung by women while performing household chores like grinding grain and spinning
Other compositions were in the form of lurinama or lullabies and shadinama or wedding songs
It is likely that the sufis of this region were inspired by the pre-existing bhakti tradition of the Kannada vachanas of the Lingayats and the Marathi abhangs of the sants of Pandharpur
It is thr ough this medium that Islam gradually gained a place in the villages of the Deccan.Amir Khusrau and the qaul Amir Khusrau (1253-1325), the great poet, musician and disciple of Shaikh Nizamuddin Auliya, gave a unique form to the Chishti sama  by introducing the qaul (Arabic word meaning saying), a hymn sung at the opening or closing of qawwali
This was followed by sufi poetry in Persian, Hindavi or Urdu, and sometimes using words from all of these languages
Qawwals (those who sing these songs) at the shrine of Shaikh Nizamuddin Auliya always start their recital with the qaul
Today qawwali is performed in shrines all over the subcontinent

However , this was by no means a situation of absolute isolation fr om political power
The sufis accepted unsolicited grants and donations from the political elites
The Sultans in turn set up charitable trusts ( auqa f) as endowments for hospices and granted tax-free land ( inam )
The Chishtis accepted donations in cash and kind
Rather than accumulate donations, they preferred to use these fully on immediate requirements such as food, clothes, living quarters and ritual necessities (such as sama ‘)
All this enhanced the moral authority of the shaikhs, which in turn attracted people fr om all walks of life
Further , their piety and scholarship, and people’s belief in their miraculous powers made sufis popular among the masses, whose support kings wished to secure
Kings did not simply need to demonstrate their association with sufis; they also required legitimation from them
When the Turks set up the Delhi Sultanate, they resisted the insistence of the ulama on imposing shari‘a as state law because they anticipated opposition from their subjects, the majority of whom were non-Muslims
The Sultans then sought out the sufis – who derived their authority directly from God – and did not depend on jurists to interpret the shari‘a
Besides, it was believed that the auliya could intercede with God in order to improve the material and spiritual conditions of ordinary human beings
This explains why kings often wanted their tombs to be in the vicinity of sufi shrines and hospices
However , ther e wer e instances of conflict between the Sultans and the sufis
To assert their authority, both expected that certain rituals be performed such as prostration and kissing of the feet
Occasionally the sufi shaikh was addressed with high-sounding titles
For example, the disciples of Nizamuddin Auliya addressed him as sultan-ul-mashaikh (literally, Sultan amongst shaikhs ).Sufis and the state Other sufis such as the Suhrawardi under the Delhi Sultans and the Naqshbandi under the Mughals were also associated with the state
However , the modes of their association were not the same as those of the Chishtis
In some cases, sufis accepted courtly offices.BHAKT I-SUFI TRADITIONS THEMES IN INDIAN HISTORY  P ART II 160 Declining a royal gift This excerpt from a sufi text describes the proceedings at Shaikh Nizamuddin Auliyas hospice in 1313: I (the author , Amir Hasan Sijzi) had the good fortune of kissing his (Shaikh Nizamuddin Auliyas) feet At this time a local ruler had sent him the deed of ownership to two gardens and much land, along with the provisions and tools for their maintenance
The ruler had also made it clear that he was relinquishing all his rights to both the gardens and land
The master had not accepted that gift
Instead, he had lamented: What have I to do with gardens and fields and lands? None of our spiritual masters had engaged in such activity . Then he told an appropriate story:  Sultan Ghiyasuddin, who at that time was still known as Ulugh Khan, came to visit Shaikh F ariduddin (and) offered some money and ownership deeds for four villages to the Shaikh, the money being for the benefit of the dervishes (sufis), and the land for his use
Smiling, Shaikh al Islam (F ariduddin) said: Give me the money
I will dispense it to the dervishes
But as for those land deeds, keep them
There are many who long for them
Give them away to such persons.Source 9 Ü What aspects of the relationship between the sufis and the state do you think are best illustrated in this account? What does the account tell us about the modes of communication between the Shaikh and his disciples? Fig

N ew De votional P aths Dialogue and Dissent in Northern India Many poet-saints engaged in explicit and implicit dialogue with these new social situations, ideas and institutions
Let us now see how this dialogue found expression
W e focus her e on thr ee of the most influential figures of the time
8.1 W eaving a divine fabric: Kabir Kabir ( c
fourteenth-fifteenth centuries) is perhaps one of the most outstanding examples of a poet-saint who emerged within this context
Historians have painstakingly tried to reconstruct his life and times through a study of compositions attributed to him as well as later hagiographies
Such exercises have proved to be challenging on a number of counts
Verses ascribed to Kabir have been compiled in three distinct but overlapping traditions
The Kabir Bijak is preserved by the Kabirpanth (the path or sect of Kabir) in V aranasi and elsewher e in Uttar Pradesh; the Kabir Granthavali is associated with the Dadupanth in Rajasthan, and many of his compositions are found in the Adi Granth Sahib (see Section 8.2)
All these manuscript compilations were made long after the death of Kabir
By the nineteenth century, anthologies of verses attributed to him circulated in print in regions as far apart as Bengal, Gujarat and Maharashtra
Kabir’s poems have survived in several languages and dialects; and some are composed in the special language of nirguna poets, the sant bhasha
Others, known as ulatbansi (upside-down sayings), are written in a form in which everyday meanings are inverted
These hint at the difficulties of capturing the nature of the Ultimate Reality in words: expressions such as “the lotus which blooms without flower” or the “fire raging in the ocean” convey a sense of Kabir’s mystical experiences
Also striking is the range of traditions Kabir drew on to describe the Ultimate Reality
These include Islam: he described the Ultimate Reality as Allah, Khuda, Hazrat and Pir
He also used ter ms drawn from V edantic traditions, alakh (the unseen), nirakar (formless), Brahman, Atman, etc
Other terms with mystical connotations such as shabda (sound) or shunya (emptiness) were drawn from yogic traditions.The One Lord Here is a composition attributed to Kabir: Tell me, br other , how can there be No one lord of the world but two? Who led you so astray? God is called by many names: Names like Allah, Ram, Karim, Keshav , Hari, and Hazrat
Gold may be shaped into rings and bangles
Isnt it gold all the same? Distinctions are only words we invent Kabir says they are both mistaken
Neither can find the only Ram
One kills the goat, the other cows
They waste their lives in disputation
Ü What is Kabir’s argument against the distinction made between gods of different communities?Source BHAKT I-SUFI TRADITIONS THEMES IN INDIAN HISTORY  P ART II 162 Diverse and sometimes conflicting ideas are expressed in these poems
Some poems draw on Islamic ideas and use monotheism and iconoclasm to attack Hindu polytheism and idol worship; others use the sufi concept of zikr and ishq (love) to express the Hindu practice of nam-simaran (remembrance of God’s name)
Were all these composed by Kabir? W e may never be able to tell with certainty, although scholars have tried to analyse the language, style and content to establish which verses could be Kabir’s
What this rich corpus of verses also signifies is that Kabir was and is to the present a source of inspiration for those who questioned entrenched religious and social institutions, ideas and practices in their search for the Divine
Just as Kabir’s ideas probably crystallised through dialogue and debate (explicit or implicit) with the traditions of sufis and yogis in the region of Awadh (part of present-day Uttar Pradesh), his legacy was claimed by several groups, who remembered him and continue to do so
This is most evident in later debates about whether he was a Hindu or a Muslim by birth, debates that are reflected in hagiographies
Many of these were composed from the seventeenth century onwards, about 200 years after Kabir’s lifetime
Hagiographies within the Vaishnava tradition attempted to suggest that he was born a Hindu, Kabirdas (Kabir itself is an Arabic word meaning “great”), but was raised by a poor Muslim family belonging to the community of weavers or julahas, who were relatively recent converts to Islam
They also suggested that he was initiated into bhakti by a guru, perhaps Ramananda
Fig
6
Roadside musicians, a seventeenth- century Mughal painting It is likely that the compositions of the sants were sung by such musicians
163 However , the verses attributed to Kabir use the words guru and satguru, but do not mention the name of any specific pr eceptor
Historians have pointed out that it is very difficult to establish that Ramananda and Kabir were contemporaries, without assigning improbably long lives to either or both
So, while traditions linking the two cannot be accepted at face value, they show how important the legacy of Kabir was for later generations
8.2 Baba Guru Nanak and the Sacr ed W ord Baba Guru Nanak (1469-1539) was born in a Hindu merchant family in a village called Nankana Sahib near the river Ravi in the predominantly Muslim Punjab
He trained to be an accountant and studied Persian
He was married at a young age but he spent most of his time among sufis and bhaktas
He also travelled widely
The message of Baba Guru Nanak is spelt out in his hymns and teachings
These suggest that he advocated a form of nirguna bhakti
He firmly repudiated the external practices of the religions he saw around him
He rejected sacrifices, ritual baths, image worship, austerities and the scriptures of both Hindus and Muslims
For Baba Guru Nanak, the Absolute or “ rab” had no gender or form
He proposed a simple way to connect to the Divine by remembering and repeating the Divine Name, expressing his ideas through hymns called “ shabad ” in Punjabi, the language of the region
Baba Guru Nanak would sing these compositions in various ragas while his attendant Mardana played the rabab
Baba Guru Nanak organised his followers into a community
He set up rules for congregational worship ( sanga t) involving collective recitation
He appointed one of his disciples, Angad, to succeed him as the preceptor ( guru), and this practice was followed for nearly 200 years
It appears that Baba Guru Nanak did not wish to establish a new religion, but after his death his followers consolidated their own practices and distinguished themselves from both Hindus and Muslims
The fifth pr eceptor , Guru Arjan , compiled Baba Guru Nanak’s hymns along with those of his four successors and other religious poets like Baba Farid, Ravidas (also known as Raidas) and Kabir in the Adi Granth Sahib
These hymns, called “gurbani”, are composed in variousBHAKT I-SUFI TRADITIONS THEMES IN INDIAN HISTORY  P ART II 164 languages
In the late seventeenth century the tenth preceptor , Guru Gobind Singh, included the compositions of the ninth guru, Guru T egh Bahadur , and this scripture was called the Guru Granth Sahib
Guru Gobind Singh also laid the foundation of the Khalsa Panth (army of the pure) and defined its five symbols: uncut hair , a dagger , a pair of shorts, a comb and a steel bangle
Under him the community got consolidated as a socio-religious and military force
8.3 Mirabai, the devotee princess Mirabai ( c
fifteenth-sixteenth centuries) is perhaps the best-known woman poet within the bhakti tradition
Biographies have been reconstructed primarily fr om the bhajans attributed to her , which were transmitted orally for centuries
According to these, she was a Rajput princess from Merta in Marwar who was married against her wishes to a prince of the Sisodia clan of Mewar , Rajasthan
She defied her husband and did not submit to the traditional r ole of wife and mother , instead recognising Krishna, the avatar of Vishnu, as her lover
Her in-laws tried to poison her , but she escaped from the palace to live as a wandering saint composing songs that are characterised by intense expressions of emotion
Love for the Lord This is part of a song attributed to Mirabai: I will build a funeral pyre of sandalwood and aloe; Light it by your own hand When I am burned away to cinders; Smear this ash upon your limbs
let flame be lost in flame
In another verse, she sings: What can Mewars ruler do to me? If God is angry , all is lost, But what can the Rana do?Source Ü What does this indicate about Mirabai’s attitude towards the king?Fig

A fifteenth-century stone sculpture (Tamil Nadu) depicting Krishna playing the flute, a form of the deity worshipped by Mirabai 165 According to some traditions, her preceptor was Raidas, a leather worker
This would indicate her defiance of the norms of caste society
After rejecting the comforts of her husband’s palace, she is supposed to have donned the white robes of a widow or the saf fron robe of the r enouncer
Although Mirabai did not attract a sect or group of followers, she has been recognised as a source of inspiration for centuries
Her songs continue to be sung by women and men, especially those who are poor and considered “low caste” in Gujarat and Rajasthan

Why do you think the traditions of Kabir , Baba Guru Nanak and Mirabai remain significant in the twenty-first century? 9
Reconstructing Histories of Religious Traditions We have seen that historians draw on a variety of sources to reconstruct histories of religious traditions – these include sculpture, architecture, stories about religious preceptors, compositions attributed to women and men engaged in the quest of understanding the nature of the Divine
As we have seen in Chapters 1 and 4, sculpture and architecture can only be understood if we have a grasp of the context – the ideas, beliefs and practices of those who produced and used these images and buildings
What about textual traditions regarding religious beliefs? If you return to the sources in this chapter , you will notice that they include a wide variety, written in several different languages and styles
They range from the apparently simple, direct language of the vachanas of Basavanna to the or nate Persian of the farman of the Mughal emperors
Understanding each type of text requires different skills: apart from a familiarity with several languages, the historian has to be aware of the subtle variations in style that characterise each genre.Shankaradeva In the late fifteenth century , Shankaradeva emerged as one of the leading proponents of Vaishnavism in Assam
His teachings, often known as the Bhagavati dharma because they were based on the Bhagavad Gita and the Bhagavata Purana, focused on absolute surrender to the supr eme deity , in this case Vishnu
He emphasised the need for naam kirtan, recitation of the names of the lord in sat sanga or congregations of pious devotees
He also encouraged the establishment of satra or monasteries for the transmission of spiritual knowledge, and naam ghar or prayer halls
Many of these institutions and practices continue to flourish in the region
His major compositions include the Kirtana-ghosha.BHAKT I-SUFI TRADITIONS THEMES IN INDIAN HISTORY  P ART II 166 Varieties of sources used to reconstruct the history of sufi traditions A wide range of texts were produced in and around sufi khanqahs
These included: 1.Treatises or manuals dealing with sufi thought and practices  The Kashf-ul-Mahjub of Ali bin Usman Hujwiri (died c
1071) is an example of this genre
It enables historians to see how traditions outside the subcontinent influenced sufi thought in India
2
Malfuzat (literally , utter ed; conversations of sufi saints)  An early te xt on malfuzat is the Fawaid-al-F uad , a collection of conversations of Shaikh Nizamuddin Auliya, compiled by Amir Hasan Sijzi Dehlavi, a noted Persian poet
Source 9 contains an excerpt from this text
Malfuzats were compiled by different sufi silsilas with the permission of the shaikhs ; these had obvious didactic purposes
Several examples have been found from different parts of the subcontinent, including the Deccan
They were compiled over several centuries
3
Maktubat (literally , written  collections of letters); letters written by sufi masters, addressed to their disciples and associates  While these tell us about the shaikhs experience of religious truth that he wanted to share with others, they also reflect the life conditions of the recipients and are responses to their aspirations and difficulties, both spiritual and mundane
The letters, known as Maktubat-i Imam Rabbani , of the noted seventeenth-century Naqshbandi Shaikh Ahmad Sirhindi (d.1624), whose ideology is often contrasted with the liberal and non -sectarian views of Akbar , are amongst those most frequently discussed by scholars
4
Tazkiras (literally , to mention and memorialise; biographical accounts of saints)  The fourteenth-century Siyar-ul-Auliya of Mir Khwurd Kirmani was the first sufi tazkira written in India
It dealt principally with the Chishti saints
The most famous tazkira is the Akhbar-ul-Akhyar of Abdul Haqq Muhaddis Dehlavi (d
1642)
The authors of the tazkiras often sought to establish the precedence of their own orders and glorify their spiritual genealogies
Many details are often implausible, full of elements of the fantastic
Still they are of great value for historians and help them to understand more fully the nature of the tradition
Remember that each of the traditions we have been considering in this chapter generated a wide range of textual and oral modes of communication, some of which have been preserved, many of which have been modified in the process of transmission, and others ar e probably lost for ever
167 Virtually all these religious traditions continue to flourish to date
This continuity has certain advantages for historians as it allows them to compare contemporary practices with those described in textual traditions or shown in old paintings and to trace changes
At the same time, because these traditions are part of peoples’ lived beliefs and practices, there is often a lack of acceptance of the possibility that these may have changed over time
The challenge for historians is to undertake such investigations with sensitivity, while at the same time recognising that religious traditions, like other traditions, are dynamic and change over time

This principle marks a departure from the legacy of bookish learning which continues to shape our system and causes a gap between the school, home and community
The syllabi and textbooks developed on the basis of NCF signify an attempt to implement this basic idea
They also attempt to discourage rote learning and the maintenance of sharp boundaries between dif ferent subject ar eas
W e hope these measur es will take us significantly further in the direction of a child-centred system of education outlined in the National Policy on Education (1986)
The success of this effort depends on the steps that school principals and teachers will take to encourage children to reflect on their own learning and to pursue imaginative activities and questions
We must r ecognise that, given space, time and fr eedom, childr en generate new knowledge by engaging with the information passed on to them by adults
T reating the pr escribed textbook as the sole basis of examination is one of the key reasons why other resources and sites of learning are ignored
Inculcating creativity and initiative is possible if we perceive and treat children as participants in learning, not as receivers of a fixed body of knowledge
These aims imply considerable change in school routines and mode of functioning
Flexibility in the daily time-table is as necessary as rigour in implementing the annual calendar so that the required number of teaching days are actually devoted to teaching
The methods used for teaching and evaluation will also determine how effective this textbook proves for making children’s life at school a happy experience, rather than a source of stress or boredom
Syllabus designers have tried to address the problem of curricular burden by restructuring and reorienting knowledge at different stages with greater consideration for child psychology and the time available for teaching
The textbook attempts to enhance this endeavour by giving higher priority and space to opportunities for contemplation and wondering, discussion in small groups, and activities requiring hands-on experience
The National Council of Educational Resear ch and T raining (NCER T) appreciates the hard work done by the textbook development committee responsible for this book
W e wish to thank the Chairperson of the advisory gr oup in Social Sciences , Professor Hari V asudevan , and the Chief Advisor for this book, Professor Neeladri Bhattacharya, Centre for Historical Studies, Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi for guiding the work of this committee
Several teachers contributed to the development of this textbook; we are grateful to their principals for making this possible
W e are indebted to the institutions and organisations which have generously permitted us to draw upon their vi resour ces, material and personnel
We are especially grateful to the members of the National Monitoring Committee, appointed by the Department of Secondary and Higher Education, Ministry of Human Resource Development under the Chairpersonship of Professor Mrinal Miri and Pr ofessor G.P
Deshpande, for their valuable time and contribution
As an organisation committed to systemic reform and continuous impr ovement in the quality of its pr oducts, NCER T welcomes comments and suggestions which will enable us to undertake further revision and refinement
Director New Delhi National Council of Educational November 2006 Resear ch and T raining vii RATIONALISATION OF CONTENT IN THE TEXTBOOKS In view of the COVID- pandemic, it is imperative to reduce content load on students
The National Education Policy 2020, also emphasises reducing the content load and providing opportunities for experiential learning with creative mindset
In this background, the NCERT has undertaken the exercise to rationalise the textbooks across all classes
Learning Outcomes already developed by the NCERT across classes have been taken into consideration in this exercise
Contents of the textbooks have been rationalised in view of the following: •Overlapping with similar content included in other subject areas in the same class •Similar content included in the lower or higher class in the same subject •Difficulty level •Content, which is easily accessible to students without much interventions from teachers and can be learned by children through self-learning or peer-learning •Content, which is irrelevant in the present context This present edition, is a reformatted version after carrying out the changes given above
viii ix DEFINING THE FOCUS OF STUD Y What defines the focus of this book? What does it seek to do? How is it linked to what has been studied in earlier classes? In Classes VI to VIII we looked at Indian history from early beginnings to modern times, with a focus on one chronological period in each year
Then in the books for Classes IX and X, the frame of r eference changed
W e looked at a shorter period of time, focusing specifically on a close study of the contemporary world
We moved beyond territorial boundaries, beyond the limits of nation states, to see how different people in different places have played their part in the making of the modern world
The history of India became connected to a wider inter -linked history
Subsequently in Class XI we studied Themes in W orld History , expanding our chronological focus, looking at the vast span of years from the beginning of human life to the present, but selecting only a set of themes for serious exploration
This year we will study Themes in Indian History
The book begins with Harappa and ends with the framing of the Indian Constitution
What it offers is not a general survey of five millennia, but a close study of select themes
The history books in earlier years have already acquainted you with Indian history
It is time we explored some themes in greater detail
In choosing the themes we have tried to ensure that we learn about developments in different spheres – economic, cultural, social, political, and religious – even as we attempt to break the boundaries between them
Some themes in the book will introduce you to the politics of the times and the nature of authority and power; others explore the way societies are organised, and the way they function and change; still others tell us about religious life and ritual practices, about the working of economies, and the changes within rural and urban societies
Each of these themes will also allow you to have a closer look at the historians’ craft
To retrieve the past, historians have to find sources that make the past accessible
But sources do not just reveal the past; historians have to grapple with sources, interpret them, and make them speak
This is what makes history exciting
The same sources can tell us new things if we ask new questions, and engage with them in new ways
So we need to see how historians read sources, and how they discover new things in old sources
But historians do not only re-examine old records
They discover new ones
Sometimes these could be chance discoveries
Archaeologists may unexpectedly come across seals and mounds that provide clues to the existence of a site of an ancient civilisation
Rummaging through the dusty records of a district collectorate a x historian may trip over a bundle of records that contain legal cases of local disputes, and these may open up a new world of village life several centuries back
Y et are such discoveries only accidents? Y ou may bump into a bundle of old records in an archive, open it up and see it, without discovering the significance of the source
The source may mean nothing to you unless you have relevant questions in mind
Y ou have to track the sour ce, read the text, follow the clues, and make the inter -connections befor e you can r econstruct the past
The physical discovery of a record does not simply open up the past
When Alexander Cunningham first saw a Harappan seal, he could make no sense of it
Only much later was the significance of the seals discovered
In fact when historians begin to ask new questions, explore new themes, they have to often search for new types of sources
If we wish to know about revolutionaries and rebels, official sources can reveal only a partial picture, one that will be shaped by official censur e and pr ejudice
W e need to look for other sour ces – diaries of rebels, their personal letters, their writings and pronouncements
And these are not always easy to come by
If we have to understand experiences of people, then oral sources might reveal more than written sources
As the vision of history broadens, historians begin tracking new sources, searching for new clues to understand the past
And when that happens, the conception of what constitutes a source itself changes
There was a time when only written records were acknowledged as authentic
What was written could be verified, cited, and cross-checked
Oral evidence was never considered a valid source: who was to guarantee its authenticity and verifiability? This mistrust of oral sources has not yet disappeared, but oral evidence has been innovatively used to uncover experiences that no other record could reveal
Through the book this year , you will enter the world of historians, accompany them in their search for new clues, and see how they carry on their dialogues with the past
Y ou will witness the way they tease out meaning out of records, read inscriptions, excavate archaeological sites, make sense of beads and bones, interpret the epics, look at the stupas and buildings, examine paintings and photographs, interpret police reports and revenue records, and listen to the voices of the past
Each theme will explore the peculiarities and possibilities of one particular type of source
It will discuss what a source can tell and what it cannot

Part III will follow

Those who visit or come to stay in a new land invariably encounter a world that is different: in terms of the landscape or physical environment as well as customs, languages, beliefs and practices of people
Many of them try to adapt to these differences; others, somewhat exceptional, note them carefully in accounts, generally recording what they find unusual or remarkable
Unfortunately, we have practically no accounts of travel left by women, though we know that they travelled
The accounts that survive are often varied in terms of their subject matter
Some deal with affairs of the court, while others are mainly focused on religious issues, or architectural features and monuments
For example, one of the most important descriptions of the city of Vijayanagara (Chapter 7) in the fifteenth century comes from Abdur Razzaq Samarqandi, a diplomat who came visiting from Herat
In a few cases, travellers d id not go to distant lands
For example, in the Mughal Empire (Chapters 8 and 9), administrators sometimes travelled within the empire and recorded their observations
Some of them were interested in looking at popular customs and the folklore and traditions of their own land
In this chapter we shall see how our knowledge of the past can be enriched through a consideration of descriptions of social life provided by travellers who visited the subcontinent, focusing on the accounts of three men: Al-Biruni who came from Uzbekistan (eleventh century), Ibn Battuta who came from Morocco, in northwestern Africa (fourteenth century) and the Frenchman François Bernier (seventeenth century).Thr ough t he Ey es of T rav eller s Perceptions of Society Perceptions of SocietyPerceptions of Society Perceptions of SocietyPerceptions of Society ( (( ((c cc cc

It is this difference in perspective that makes the accounts of travellers interesting
Who did these travellers write for? As we will see, the answers vary from one instance to the next
1
Al-Biruni and t he Kitab-ul-Hind 1.1 From Khwarizm to the Punjab Al-Biruni was born in 973, in Khwarizm in present- day Uzbekistan
Khwarizm was an important centre of learning, and Al-Biruni received the best education available at the time
He was well versed in several languages: Syriac, Arabic, Persian, Hebrew and Sanskrit
Although he did not know Greek, he was familiar with the works of Plato and other Greek philosophers, having read them in Arabic translations
In 1017, when Sultan Mahmud invaded Khwarizm, he took several scholars and poets back to his capital, Ghazni; Al-Biruni was one of them
He arrived in Ghazni as a hostage, but gradually developed a liking for the city, where he spent the rest of his life until his death at the age of
It was in Ghazni that Al-Biruni developed an interest in India
This was not unusual
Sanskrit works on astronomy, mathematics and medicine had been translated into Arabic from the eighth century onwards
When the Punjab became a part of the Ghaznavid empire, contacts with the local population helped create an environment of mutual trust and understanding
Al-Biruni spent years in the company of Brahmana priests and scholars, learning Sanskrit, and studying religious and philosophical texts
While his itinerary is not clear, it is likely that he travelled widely in the Punjab and parts of northern India
Travel literature was already an accepted part of Arabic literature by the time he wrote
This literature dealt with lands as far apart as the Sahara desert in the west to the River Volga in the north
So, whileTranslating te xts, sharing ideas Al-Birunis expertise in several languages allowed him to compare languages and translate texts
He translated several Sanskrit works, including Patanjalis work on grammar , into Arabic
For his Brahmana friends, he translated the works of Euclid (a Greek mathematician) into Sanskrit.Al-Birunis objectives Al-Biruni described his work as: a help to those who want to discuss religious questions with them (the Hindus), and as a repertory of information to those who want to associate with them.Source 1 Ü Read the excerpt from Al-Biruni (Source 5) and discuss whether his work met these objectives
117 few people in India would have read Al-Biruni before 1500, many others outside India may have done so
1.2 The Kitab-ul-Hind Al-Biruni’s Kitab-ul-Hind, written in Arabic, is simple and lucid
It is a voluminous text, divided into chapters on subjects such as religion and philosophy, festivals, astronomy, alchemy, manners and customs, social life, weights and measures, iconography, laws and metrology
Generally (though not always), Al-Biruni adopted a distinctive structure in each chapter, beginning with a question, following this up with a description based on Sanskritic traditions, and concluding with a comparison with other cultures
Some present-day scholars have argued that this almost geometric structure, remarkable for its precision and predictability, owed much to his mathematica l orientation
Al-Biruni, who wrote in Arabic, probably intended his work for peoples living along the frontiers of the subcontinent
He was familiar with translations and adaptations of Sanskrit, Pali and Prakrit texts into Arabic – these ranged from fables to works on astronomy and medicine
However, he was also critical about the ways in which these texts were written, and clearly wanted to improve on them.THROUGH THE EYES OF TRAVELLERS Metrology is the science of measurement
Hindu The term Hindu was derived from an Old Persian word, used c
sixth-fifth centuries BCE, to refer to the region east of the river Sindhu (Indus)
The Arabs continued the Persian usage and called this region al-Hind and its people Hindi
L ater the Turks r eferr ed to the people east of the Indus as Hindu, their land as Hindustan , and their language as Hindavi
None of these expressions indicated the religious identity of the people
It was much later that the term developed religious connotations
Ü Discuss..
If Al-Biruni lived in the twenty-first century, which are the areas of the world where he could have been easily understood, if he still knew the same languages? Fig

Ibn Battut as Rihla 2.1 An early globe-trotter Ibn Battuta’s book of travels, called Rihla, written in Arabic, provides extremely rich and interesting details about the social and cultural life in the subcontinent in the fourteenth century
This Moroccan traveller was born in Tangier into one of the most respectable and educated families known for their expertise in Islamic religious law or shari‘a
True to the tradition of his family, Ibn Battuta received literary and scholastic education when he was quite young
Unlike most other members of his class, Ibn Battuta considered experience gained through travels to be a more important source of knowledge than books
He just loved travelling, and went to far-off places, exploring new worlds and peoples
Before he set off for India in 1332-, he had made pilgrimage trips to Mecca, and had already travelled extensively in Syria, Iraq, Persia, Yemen, Oman and a few trading ports on the coast of East Africa
Travelling overland through Central Asia, Ibn Battuta reached Sind in 1333
He had heard about Muhammad bin Tughlaq, the Sultan of Delhi, and lured by his reputation as a generous patron of arts and letters, set off for Delhi, passing through Multan and Uch
The Sultan was impressed by his scholarship, and appointed him the qazi or judge of Delhi
He remained in that position for several years, until he fell out of favour and was thrown into prison
Once the misunderstanding between him and the Sultan was cleared, he was restored to imperial service, and was ordered in 1342 to proceed to China as the Sultan’s envoy to the Mongol ruler
With the new assignment, Ibn Battuta proceeded to the Malabar coast through central India
From Malabar he went to the Maldives, where he stayed for eighteen months as the qazi, but eventually decided to proceed to Sri Lanka
He then went back once more to the Malabar coast and the Maldives, and before resuming his mission to China, visited Bengal and Assam as well
He took a ship to Sumatra, and from there another ship for the Chinese port town ofSource 2 Fig
5.3 Robbers attacking travellers, a sixteenth-century Mughal painting Ü How can you distinguish the travellers from the robbers?The bird leaves its nest This is an excerpt from the Rihla: My departur e from T angier , my birthplace, took place on Thursday ..
I set out alone, having neither fellow- traveller ..
nor caravan whose party I might join, but swayed by an overmastering impulse within me and a desire long-cherished in my bosom to visit these illustrious sanctuaries
So I braced my resolution to quit all my dear ones, female and male, and forsook my home as birds forsake their nests ..
My age at that time was twenty-two years
Ibn Battuta returned home in 1354, about years after he had set out
119 Zaytun (now known as Quanzhou)
He travelled extensively in China, going as far as Beijing, but did not stay for long, deciding to return home in 1347
His account is often compared with that of Marco Polo, who visited China (and also India) from his home base in Venice in the late thirteenth century
Ibn Battuta meticulously recorded his observations about new cultures, peoples, beliefs, values, etc
We need to bear in mind that this globe-trotter was travelling in the fourteenth century, when it was much more arduous and hazardous to travel than it is today
According to Ibn Battuta, it took forty days to travel from Multan to Delhi and about fifty days from Sind to Delhi
The distance from Daulatabad to Delhi was covered in forty days, while that from Gwalior to Delhi took ten days.Fig

THEMES IN INDIAN HISTORY  P ART II 120 Travelling was also more insecure: Ibn Battuta was attacked by bands of robbers several times
In fact he preferred travelling in a caravan along with companions, but this did not deter highway robbers
While travelling from Multan to Delhi, for instance, his caravan was attacked and many of his fellow travellers lost their lives; those travellers who survived, including Ibn Battuta, were severely wounded
2.2 The “enjoyment of curiosities” As we have seen, Ibn Battuta was an inveterate traveller who spent several years travelling through north Africa, West Asia and parts of Central Asia (he may even have visited Russia), the Indian subcontinent and China, before returning to his native land, Morocco
When he returned, the local ruler issued instructions that his stories be recorded.Map 1 Places visited by Ibn Battuta in Afghanistan, Sind and Punjab

Accor dingly , he dictated upon these subjects a narrative which gave entertainment to the mind and delight to the ears and eyes, with a variety of curious particulars by the exposition of which he gave edification and of marvellous things, by referring to which he aroused interest
In the footsteps of Ibn Battuta In the centuries between 1400 and 1800 visitors to India wrote a number of travelogues in Persian
At the same time, Indian visitors to Central Asia, Iran and the Ottoman empire also sometimes wrote about their experiences
These writers followed in the footsteps of Al-Biruni and Ibn Battuta, and had sometimes read these earlier authors
Among the best known of these writers were Abdur Razzaq Samarqandi, who visited south India in the 1440s, Mahmud W ali Balkhi, who travelled very widely in the 1620s, and Shaikh Ali Hazin, who came to north India in the 1740s
Some of these authors were fascinated by India, and one of them  Mahmud Balkhi  even became a sort of sanyasi for a time
Others such as Hazin were disappointed and even disgusted with India, where they expected to receive a red carpet treatment
Most of them saw India as a land of wonders.Source 3 THROUGH THE EYES OF TRAVELLERS Fig

François Bernier A Doctor with a Difference Once the Portuguese arrived in India in about 1500, a number of them wrote detailed accounts regarding Indian social customs and religious practices
A few of them, such as the Jesuit Roberto Nobili, even translated Indian texts into European languages
Among the best known of the Portuguese writers is Duarte Barbosa, who wrote a detailed account of trade and society in south India
Later, after 1600, we find growing numbers of Dutch, English and French travellers coming to India
One of the most famous was the French jeweller Jean-Baptiste Tavernier, who travelled to India at least six times
He was particularly fascinated with the trading conditions in India, and compared India to Iran and the Ottoman empire
Some of these travellers, like the Italian doctor Manucci, never returned to Europe, and settled down in India
François Bernier, a Frenchman, was a doctor, political philosopher and historian
Like many others, he came to the Mughal Empire in search of opportunities
He was in India for twelve years, from 1656 to 1668, and was closely associated with the Mughal court, as a physician to Prince Dara Shukoh, the eldest son of Emperor Shah Jahan, and later as an intellectual and scientist, with Danishmand Khan, an Armenian noble at the Mughal court
3.1 Comparing “East” and “West” Bernier travelled to several parts of the country, and wrote accounts of what he saw, frequently comparing what he saw in India with the situation in Europe
He dedicated his major writing to Louis XIV, the king of France, and many of his other works were written in the form of letters to influential officials and ministers
In virtually every instance Bernier described what he saw in India as a bleak situation in comparison to developments in Europe
As we will see, this assessment was not always accurate
However, when his works were published, Bernier’s writings became extremely popular.Fig

I am also provided with every useful article, such as a tent of moderate size, a carpet, a portable bed made of four very str ong but light canes, a pillow , a mattr ess, r ound leather table-cloths used at meals, some few napkins of dyed cloth, three small bags with culinary utensils which are all placed in a large bag, and this bag is again carried in a very capacious and strong double sack or net made of leather thongs

Bernier’s works were published in France in 1670- and translated into English, Dutch, German and Italian within the next five years
Between 1670 and 1725 his account was reprinted eight times in French, and by 1684 it had been reprinted three times in English
This was in marked contrast to the accounts in Arabic and Persian, which circulated as manuscripts and were generally not published before 1800.The creation and circulation of ideas about India The writings of European travellers helped produce an image of India for Europeans through the printing and circulation of their books
Later, after 1750, when Indians like Shaikh Itisamuddin and Mirza Abu T alib visited Eur ope and confronted this image that Europeans had of their society , they tried to influence it by producing their own version of matters

Making Sense of an Alien W orld Al-Biruni and the Sanskritic Tradition 4.1 Overcoming barriers to understanding As we have seen, travellers often compared what they saw in the subcontinent with practices with which they were familiar
Each traveller adopted distinct strategies to understand what they observed
Al-Biruni, for instance, was aware of the problems inherent in the task he had set himself
He discussed several “barriers” that he felt obstructed understanding
The first amongst these was language
According to him, Sanskrit was so different from Arabic and Persian that ideas and concepts could not be easily translated from one language into another
The second barrier he identified was the difference in religious beliefs and practices
The self-absorption and consequent insularity of the local population according to him, constituted the third barrier
What is interesting is that even though he was aware of these problems, Al-Biruni depended almost exclusively on the works of Brahmanas, often citing passages from the Vedas, the Puranas, the Bhagavad Gita, the works of Patanjali, the Manusmriti , etc., to provide an understanding of Indian society
4.2 Al-Biruni’s description of the caste system Al-Biruni tried to explain the caste system by looking for parallels in other societies
He noted that in ancient Persia, four social categories were recognised: those of knights and princes; monks, fire-priests and lawyers; physicians, astronomers and other scientists; and finally, peasants and artisans
In other words, he attempted to suggest that social divisions were not unique to India
At the same time he pointed out that within Islam all men were considered equal, differing only in their observance of piety
In spite of his acceptance of the Brahmanical description of the caste system, Al-Biruni disapproved of the notion of pollution
He remarked that everything which falls into a state of impurity strives and succeeds in regaining its original condition of purity
The sun cleanses the air, and the salt in the sea prevents the water from becoming polluted
If itA language with an enormous range Al-Biruni described Sanskrit as follows: If you want to conquer this difficulty (i.e
to learn Sanskrit), you will not find it easy , because the language is of an enormous range, both in words and inflections, something like the Arabic, calling one and the same thing by various names, both original and derivative, and using one and the same word for a variety of subjects, which, in order to be properly understood, must be distinguished from each other by various qualifying epithets
God knows best! Travellers did not always believe what they were told
When faced with the story of a wooden idol that supposedly lasted for 216,432 years, Al-Biruni asks: How , then, could wood have lasted such a length of time, and particularly in a place where the air and the soil are rather wet? God knows best! 125 were not so, insisted Al-Biruni, life on earth would have been impossible
The conception of social pollution, intrinsic to the caste system, was according to him, contrary to the laws of nature
The system of varnas This is Al-Birunis account of the system of varnas: The highest caste are the Brahmana, of whom the books of the Hindus tell us that they were created from the head of Brahman
And as the Brahman is only another name for the force called nature, and the head is the highest part of the body , the Brahmana ar e the choice part of the whole genus
Therefore the Hindus consider them as the very best of mankind
The next caste are the Kshatriya, who were created, as they say , from the shoulders and hands of Brahman
Their degree is not much below that of the Brahmana
After them follow the V aishya, who wer e created fr om the thigh of Brahman
The Shudra, who were created from his feet
Between the latter two classes there is no very great distance
Much, however , as these classes differ fr om each other , they live together in the same towns and villages, mixed together in the same houses and lodgings
As we have seen, Al-Biruni’s description of the caste system was deeply influenced by his study of normative Sanskrit texts which laid down the rules governing the system from the point of view of the Brahmanas
However, in real life the system was not quite as rigid
For instance, the categories defined as antyaja (literally, born outside the system) were often expected to provide inexpensive labour to both peasants and zamindars (see also Chapter 8)
In other words, while they were often subjected to social oppression, they were included within economic networks.Ü Discuss..

Ibn Battut a and t he Ex citement of t he U nfamiliar By the time Ibn Battuta arrived in Delhi in the fourteenth century, the subcontinent was part of a global network of communication that stretched from China in the east to north-west Africa and Europe in the west
As we have seen, Ibn Battuta himself travelled extensively through these lands, visiting sacred shrines, spending time with learned men and rulers, often officiating as qazi, and enjoying the cosmopolitan culture of urban centres where people who spoke Arabic, Persian, Turkish and other languages, shared ideas, information and anecdotes
These included stories about men noted for their piety, kings who could be both cruel and generous, and about the lives of ordinary men and women; anything that was unfamiliar was particularly highlighted in order to ensure that the listener or the reader was suitably impressed by accounts of distant yet accessible worlds
5.1 The coconut and the paan Some of the best examples of Ibn Battuta’s strategies of representation are evident in the ways in which he described the coconut and the paan, two kinds of plant produce that were completely unfamiliar to his audience
The paan Read Ibn Battutas description of the paan: The betel is a tree which is cultivated in the same manner as the grape-vine; The betel has no fruit and is grown only for the sake of its leaves The manner of its use is that before eating it one takes areca nut; this is like a nutmeg but is broken up until it is reduced to small pellets, and one places these in his mouth and chews them
Then he takes the leaves of betel, puts a little chalk on them, and masticates them along with the betel.Nuts lik e a man s head The following is how Ibn Battuta described the coconut: These trees are among the most peculiar trees in kind and most astonishing in habit
They look exactly like date-palms, without any difference between them except that the one produces nuts as its fruits and the other produces dates
The nut of a coconut tree r esembles a man s head, for in it are what look like two eyes and a mouth, and the inside of it when it is green looks like the brain, and attached to it is a fibre which looks lik e hair
They make from this cords with which they sew up ships instead of (using) iron nails, and they (also) make from it cables for vessels.Source 6 Ü What are the comparisons that Ibn Battuta makes to give his readers an idea about what coconuts looked like? Do you think these are appropriate? How does he convey a sense that this fruit is unusual? How accurate is his description?Source 7 Ü Why do you think this attracted Ibn Battuta’s attention? Is there anything you would like to add to this description? 127 5.2 Ibn Battuta and Indian cities Ibn Battuta found cities in the subcontinent full of exciting opportunities for those who had the necessary drive, resources and skills
They were densely populated and prosperous, except for the occasional disruptions caused by wars and invasions
It appears from Ibn Battuta’s account that most cities had crowded streets and bright and colourful markets that were stacked with a wide variety of goods
Ibn Battuta described Delhi as a vast city, with a great population, the largest in India
Daulatabad (in Maharashtra) was no less, and easily rivalled Delhi in size
Source 8 Dehli Here is an excerpt from Ibn Battutas account of Delhi, often spelt as Dehli in texts of the period: The city of Dehli covers a wide area and has a large population ..
The rampart round the city is without parallel
The breadth of its wall is eleven cubits; and inside it are houses for the night sentry and gate- keepers
Inside the ramparts, there are store-houses for storing edibles , magazines, ammunition, ballistas and siege machines
The grains that are stored (in these ramparts) can last for a long time, without rotting ..
In the interior of the rampart, horsemen as well as infantrymen move fr om one end of the city to another
The rampart is pier ced through by windows which open on the side of the city , and it is through these windows that light enters inside
The lower part of the rampart is built of stone; the upper part of bricks
It has many towers close to one another
Ther e are twenty eight gates of this city which are called darwaza , and of these, the Budaun darwaza is the greatest; inside the Mandwi darwaza there is a grain market; adjacent to the Gul darwaza there is an orchard ..
It (the city of Dehli) has a fine cemetery in which graves have domes over them, and those that do not have a dome, have an arch, for sure
In the cemetery they sow flowers such as tuberose, jasmine, wild rose, etc.; and flowers blossom there in all seasons.Ü What were the architectural features that Ibn Battuta noted? Compare this description with the illustrations of the city shown in Figs

5.9 (left) Part of the fortification wall of the settlement THEMES IN INDIAN HISTORY  P ART II 128 The bazaars were not only places of economic transactions, but also the hub of social and cultural activities
Most bazaars had a mosque and a temple, and in some of them at least, spaces were marked for public performances by dancers, musicians and singers
While Ibn Battuta was not particularly concerned with explaining the prosperity of towns, historians have used his account to suggest that towns derived a significant portion of their wealth through the appropriation of surplus from villages
Ibn Battuta found Indian agriculture very productive because of the fertility of the soil, which allowed farmers to cultivate two crops a year
He also noted that the subcontinent was well integrated with inter-Asian networks of trade and commerce, with Indian manufactures being in great demand in both West Asia and Southeast Asia, fetching huge profits for artisans and merchants
Indian textiles, particularly cotton cloth, fine muslins, silks, brocade and satin, were in great demand
Ibn Battuta informs us that certain varieties of fine muslin were so expensive that they could be worn only by the nobles and the very rich
Music in the market Read Ibn Battutas description of Daulatabad: In Daulatabad there is a market place for male and female singers, which is known as T arababad
It is one of the greatest and most beautiful bazaars
It has numerous shops and every shop has a door which leads into the house of the owner ..
The shops are decorated with carpets and at the centre of a shop there is a swing on which sits the female singer
She is decked with all kinds of finery and her female attendants swing her
In the middle of the mark et place ther e stands a large cupola, which is carpeted and decorated and in which the chief of the musicians takes his place every Thursday after the dawn prayers, accompanied by his servants and slaves
The female singers come in successive crowds, sing before him and dance until dusk after which he withdraws
In this bazaar there are mosques for offering prayers ..
One of the Hindu rulers ..
alighted at the cupola every time he passed by this market place, and the female singers would sing before him
Even some Muslim rulers did the same.Source 9 Fig

Ikat weaving patterns such as this were adopted and modified at several coastal production centres in the subcontinent and in Southeast Asia
Ü Why do you think Ibn Battuta highlighted these activities in his description? 129 5.3 A unique system of communication The state evidently took special measures to encourage merchants
Almost all trade routes were well supplied with inns and guest houses
Ibn Battuta was also amazed by the efficiency of the postal system which allowed merchants to not only send information and remit credit across long distances, but also to dispatch goods required at short notice
The postal system was so efficient that while it took fifty days to reach Delhi from Sind, the news reports of spies would reach the Sultan through the postal system in just five days
On horse and on foot This is how Ibn Battuta describes the postal system: In India the postal system is of two kinds
The horse- post, called uluq, is run by royal horses stationed at a distance of every four miles
The foot-post has three stations per mile; it is called dawa, that is one-third of a mile ..
Now , at every thir d of a mile ther e is a well- populated village, outside which are three pavilions in which sit men with girded loins ready to start
Each of them carries a rod, two cubits in length, with copper bells at the top
When the courier starts from the city he holds the letter in one hand and the rod with its bells on the other; and he runs as fast as he can
When the men in the pavilion hear the ringing of the bell they get ready
As soon as the courier r eaches them, one of them takes the letter from his hand and runs at top speed shaking the rod all the while until he reaches the next dawa
And the same process continues till the letter reaches its destination
This foot-post is quicker than the horse-post; and often it is used to transport the fruits of Khurasan which are much desired in India

How did Ibn Battuta handle the problem of describing things or situations to people who had not seen or experienced them?A strange nation? The travelogue of Abdur Razzaq written in the 1440s is an interesting mixture of emotions and perceptions
On the one hand, he did not appreciate what he saw in the port of Calicut (present-day Kozhikode) in Kerala, which was populated by a people the likes of whom I had never imagined, describing them as a strange nation 
Later in his visit to India, he arrived in Mangalore, and crossed the W estern Ghats
Her e he saw a temple that filled him with admiration: Within three leagues (about nine miles of Mangalore, I saw an idol-house the likes of which is not to be found in all the world
It was a square, approximately ten yards a side, five yards in height, all covered with cast bronze, with four porticos

Bernier and the Degenerate East If Ibn Battuta chose to describe everything that impressed and excited him because of its novelty, François Bernier belonged to a different intellectual tradition
He was far more preoccupied with comparing and contrasting what he saw in India with the situation in Europe in general and France in particular, focusing on situations which he considered depressing
His idea seems to have been to influence policy-makers and the intelligentsia to ensure that they made what he considered to be the “right” decisions
Bernier’s Travels in the Mughal Empire is marked by detailed observations, critical insights and reflection
His account contains discussions trying to place the history of the Mughals within some sort of a universal framework
He constantly compared Mughal India with contemporary Europe, generally emphasising the superiority of the latter
His representation of India works on the model of binary opposition, where India is presented as the inverse of Europe
He also ordered the perceived differences hierarchically, so that India appeared to be inferior to the Western world
6.1 The question of landownership According to Bernier, one of the fundamental differences between Mughal India and Europe was the lack of private property in land in the former
He was a firm believer in the virtues of private property, and saw crown ownership of land as being harmful for both the state and its people
He thought that in the Mughal Empire the emperor owned all the land and distributed it among his nobles, and that this had disastrous consequences for the economy and society
This perception was not unique to Bernier, but is found in most travellers’ accounts of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries
Owing to crown ownership of land, argued Bernier, landholders could not pass on their land to their children
So they were averse to any long-term investment in the sustenance and expansion of production
The absence of private property in land had, therefore, prevented the emergence of the class of “improving” landlords (as in Western Europe) withWidespread poverty Pelsaert, a Dutch traveller , visited the subcontinent during the early decades of the seventeenth century
Lik e Bernier , he was shocked to see the widespread poverty , poverty so gr eat and miserable that the life of the people can be depicted or accurately described only as the home of stark want and the dwelling place of bitter woe
Holding the state responsible, he says: So much is wrung from the peasants that even dry bread is scarcely left to fill their stomachs. 131 a concern to maintain or improve the land
It had led to the uniform ruination of agriculture, excessive oppression of the peasantry and a continuous decline in the living standards of all sections of society, except the ruling aristocracy
The poor peasant An excerpt from Berniers description of the peasantry in the countryside: Of the vast tracts of country constituting the empire of Hindustan, many are little more than sand, or barren mountains, badly cultivated, and thinly populated
Even a considerable portion of the good land remains untilled for want of labourers; many of whom perish in consequence of the bad treatment they experience from Governors
The poor people, when they become incapable of discharging the demands of their rapacious lords, are not only often deprived of the means of subsistence, but are also made to lose their children, who are carried away as slaves
Thus, it happens that the peasantry , driven to despair by so excessive a tyranny , abandon the country
In this instance, Bernier was participating in contemporary debates in Europe concerning the nature of state and society , and intended that his description of Mughal India would serve as a warning to those who did not r ecognise the merits of private pr operty
As an extension of this, Bernier described Indian society as consisting of undifferentiated masses of impoverished people, subjugated by a small minority of a very rich and powerful ruling class
Between the poorest of the poor and the richest of the rich, there was no social group or class worth the name
Bernier confidently asserted: “There is no middle state in India.”Source Ü What, accor ding to Ber nier, were the problems faced by peasants in the subcontinent? Do you think his description would have served to strengthen his case?THROUGH THE EYES OF TRAVELLERS Fig

Drawings such as this nineteenth-century example often reinforced the notion of an unchanging rural society
THEMES IN INDIAN HISTORY  P ART II 132 This, then, is how Bernier saw the Mughal Empire – its king was the king of “beggars and barbarians”; its cities and towns were ruined and contaminated with “ill air”; and its fields, “overspread with bushes” and full of “pestilential marishes”
And, all this was because of one reason: crown ownership of land
Curiously, none of the Mughal official documents suggest that the state was the sole owner of land
For instance, Abu’l Fazl, the sixteenth-century official chronicler of Akbar’s reign, describes the land revenue as “remunerations of sovereignty”, a claim made by the ruler on his subjects for the protection he provided rather than as rent on land that he owned
It is possible that European travellers regarded such claims as rent because land revenue demands were often very high
However, this was actually not a rent or even a land tax, but a tax on the crop (for more details, see Chapter 8)
Bernier’s descriptions influenced Western theorists from the eighteenth century onwards
The French philosopher Montesquieu, for instance, used this account to develop the idea of oriental despotism, according to which rulers in Asia (the Orient or the East) enjoyed absolute authority over their subjects, who were kept in conditions of subjugation and poverty, arguing that all land belonged to the king and that private property was non-existent
According to this view, everybody, except the emperor and his nobles, barely managed to survive
This idea was further developed as the concept of the Asiatic mode of production by Karl Marx in the nineteenth century
He argued that in India (and other Asian countries), before colonialism, surplus was appropriated by the state
This led to the emergence of a society that was composed of a large number of autonomous and (internally) egalitarian village communities
The imperial court presided over these village communities, respecting their autonomy as long as the flow of surplus was unimpeded
This was regarded as a stagnant system
However, as we will see (Chapter 8), this picture of rural society was far from true
In fact, during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, rural society was characterised by considerable social and economic differentiation
At one end of the spectrum were the big zamindars , who enjoyed superior rights in land and, at the other, the “untouchable” landlessA warning for Europe Bernier warned that if European kings followed the Mughal model: Their kingdoms would be very far from being well- cultivated and peopled, so well built, so rich, so polite and flourishing as we see them
Our kings are otherwise rich and powerful; and we must avow that they are much better and more royally served
They would soon be kings of deserts and solitudes, of beggars and barbarians, such as those are whom I have been representing (the Mughals) W e should find the great Cities and the great Burroughs (boroughs) rendered uninhabitable because of ill air , and to fall to ruine (ruin) without any bodies (anybody) taking care of repairing them; the hillocks abandon d, and the fields overspread with bushes, or filld with pestilential marishes (marshes), as hath been already intimated.Source Ü How does Bernier depict a scenario of doom? Once you have read Chapters 8 and 9, return to this description and analyse it again
133 labourers
In between was the big peasant, who used hired labour and engaged in commodity production, and the smaller peasant who could barely produce for his subsistence
6.2 A more complex social reality While Bernier’s preoccupation with projecting the Mughal state as tyrannical is obvious, his descriptions occasionally hint at a more complex social reality
For instance, he felt that artisans had no incentive to improve the quality of their manufactures, since profits were appropriated by the state
Manufactures were, consequently, everywhere in decline
At the same time, he conceded that vast quantities of the world’s precious metals flowed into India, as manufactures were exported in exchange for gold and silver
He also noticed the existence of a prosperous merchant community, engaged in long-distance exchange
Source A different socio-economic scenario Read this excerpt from Berniers description of both agriculture and craft production: It is important to observe, that of this vast tract of country , a large portion is extremely fertile; the large kingdom of Bengale (Bengal), for instance, surpassing Egypt itself, not only in the production of rice, corn, and other necessaries of life, but of innumerable articles of commerce which are not cultivated in Egypt; such as silks, cotton, and indigo
There are also many parts of the Indies, where the population is sufficiently abundant, and the land pretty well tilled; and where the artisan, although naturally indolent, is yet compelled by necessity or otherwise to employ himself in manufacturing carpets, brocades, embroideries, gold and silver cloths, and the various sorts of silk and cotton goods, which are used in the country or exported abroad
It should not escape notice that gold and silver , after circulating in every other quarter of the globe, come at length to be swallowed up, lost in some measure, in Hindustan

A gold spoon studded with emeralds and rubies, an example of the dexterity of Mughal artisans THEMES IN INDIAN HISTORY  P ART II 134 In fact, during the seventeenth century about per cent of the population lived in towns
This was, on average, higher than the proportion of urban population in Western Europe in the same period
In spite of this Bernier described Mughal cities as “camp towns”, by which he meant towns that owed their existence, and depended for their survival, on the imperial camp
He believed that these came into existence when the imperial court moved in and rapidly declined when it moved out
He suggested that they did not have viable social and economic foundations but were dependent on imperial patronage
As in the case of the question of landownership, Bernier was drawing an oversimplified picture
There were all kinds of towns: manufacturing towns, trading towns, port-towns, sacred centres, pilgrimage towns, etc
Their existence is an index of the prosperity of merchant communities and professional classes
Merchants often had strong community or kin ties, and were organised into their own caste-cum- occupational bodies
In western India these groups were called mahajans, and their chief, the sheth
In urban centres such as Ahmedabad the mahajans were collectively represented by the chief of the merchant community who was called the nagarsheth
Other urban groups included professional classes such as physicians ( hakim or vaid), teachers (pundit or mulla ), lawyers (wakil), painters, architects, musicians, calligraphers, etc
While some depended on imperial patronage, many made their living by serving other patrons, while still others served ordinary people in crowded markets or bazaars.The imperial karkhanas Bernier is perhaps the only historian who provides a detailed account of the working of the imperial karkhanas or workshops: Large halls are seen at many places, called karkhanas or workshops for the artisans
In one hall, embroiderers are busily employed, superintended by a master
In another , you see the goldsmiths; in a third, painters; in a fourth, varnishers in lacquer-work; in a fifth, joiners, turners, tailors and shoe-makers; in a sixth, manufacturers of silk, brocade and fine muslins The artisans come every morning to their karkhanas where they remain employed the whole day; and in the evening return to their homes
In this quiet regular manner , their time glides away; no one aspiring for any improvement in the condition of life wherein he happens to be born
Ü How does Bernier convey a sense that although there was a great deal of activity, there was little progress?Source Ü Discuss..
Why do you think scholars like Bernier chose to compare India with Europe? 135 Slave women Ibn Battuta informs us: It is the habit of the emperor ..
to keep with every noble, great or small, one of his slaves who spies on the nobles
He also appoints female scavengers who enter the houses unannounced; and to them the slave girls communicate all the information they possess
Most female slaves were captured in raids and expeditions.7
Women Sla ves, Sati and Labour ers Travellers who left written accounts were generally men who were interested in and sometimes intrigued by the condition of women in the subcontinent
Sometimes they took social inequities for granted as a “natural” state of affairs
For instance, slaves were openly sold in markets, like any other commodity, and were regularly exchanged as gifts
When Ibn Battuta reached Sind he purchased “horses, camels and slaves” as gifts for Sultan Muhammad bin Tughlaq
When he reached Multan, he presented the governor with, “a slave and horse together with raisins and almonds”
Muhammad bin Tughlaq, informs Ibn Battuta, was so happy with the sermon of a preacher named Nasiruddin that he gave him “a hundred thousand tankas (coins) and two hundred slaves”
It appears from Ibn Battuta’s account that there was considerable differentiation among slaves
Some female slaves in the service of the Sultan were experts in music and dance, and Ibn Battuta enjoyed their performance at the wedding of the Sultan’s sister
Female slaves were also employed by the Sultan to keep a watch on his nobles
Slaves were generally used for domestic labour, and Ibn Battuta found their services particularly indispensable for carrying women and men on palanquins or dola
The price of slaves, particularly female slaves required for domestic labour, was very low, and most families who could afford to do so kept at least one or two of them
Contemporary European travellers and writers often highlighted the treatment of women as a crucial marker of difference between Western and Eastern societies
Not surprisingly, Bernier chose the practice of sati for detailed description
He noted that while some women seemed to embrace death cheerfully, others were forced to die.Source THROUGH THE EYES OF TRAVELLERS Source The child sati This is perhaps one of the most poignant descriptions by Bernier: At Lahore I saw a most beautiful young widow sacrificed, who could not, I think, have been more than twelve years of age
The poor little creature appeared more dead than alive when she approached the dreadful pit: the agony of her mind cannot be described; she trembled and wept bitterly; but three or four of the Brahmanas, assisted by an old woman who held her under the arm, forced the unwilling victim toward the fatal spot, seated her on the wood, tied her hands and feet, lest she should run away , and in that situation the innocent creature was burnt alive
I found it difficult to repress my feelings and to prevent their bursting forth into clamorous and unavailing rage THEMES IN INDIAN HISTORY  P ART II 136 However, women’s lives revolved around much else besides the practice of sati
Their labour was crucial in both agricultural and non-agricultural production
Women from merchant families participated in commercial activities, sometimes even taking mercantile disputes to the court of law
It therefore seems unlikely that women were confined to the private spaces of their homes
You may have noticed that travellers’ accounts provide us with a tantalising glimpse of the lives of men and women during these centuries
However, their observations were often shaped by the contexts from which they came
At the same time, there were many aspects of social life that these travellers did not notice
Also relatively unknown are the experiences and observations of men (and possibly women) from the subcontinent who crossed seas and mountains and ventured into lands beyond the subcontinent
What did they see and hear? How were their relations with peoples of distant lands shaped? What were the languages they used? These and other questions will hopefully be systematically addressed by historians in the years to come.Ü Discuss..
Why do you think the lives of ordinary women workers did not attract the attention of travellers such as Ibn Battuta and Bernier? Fig

A painting depicting travellers at rest THEMES IN INDIAN HISTORY In this chapter we shall go on a long journey across a thousand years to read about philosophers and their attempts to understand the world they inhabited
W e will also see how their ideas were compiled as oral and written texts as well as expressed in architecture and sculpture
These are indicative of the enduring influence these thinkers had on people
While we will be focusing on Buddhism, it is important to remember that this tradition did not develop in isolation – there were several other traditions, each engaged in debates and dialogues with the others
The sources that historians use to reconstruct this exciting world of ideas and beliefs include Buddhist, Jaina and Brahmanical texts, as well as a large and impressive body of material remains including monuments and inscriptions
Among the best preserved monuments of the time is the stupa at Sanchi which is a major focus in this chapter

A Glim pse of Sanc hi Sanchi in the nineteenth century The most wonderful ancient buildings in the state of Bhopal are at Sanchi Kanakhera, a small village under the brow of a hill some miles north-east of Bhopal which we visited yester day
We inspected the stone sculptur es and statues of the Buddha and an ancient gateway The ruins appear to be the object of great interest to European gentlemen
Major Alexander Cunningham stayed several weeks in this neighbourhood and examined these ruins most car efully
He took drawings of the place, decipher ed the inscription, and bored shafts down these domes
The results of his investigations were described by him in an English work FROM SHAHJEHAN BEGUM , N AWAB OF BHOP AL (ruled 1868-1901), Taj- ul Iqbal T arikh Bhopal (A History of Bhopal) , translated by H.D

4.2 Shahjehan Begum Nineteenth-century Europeans were very interested in the stupa at Sanchi
In fact, the French sought Shahjehan Begum’s permission to take away the eastern gateway, which was the best preserved, to be displayed in a museum in France
For a while some Englishmen also wanted to do the same, but fortunately both the French and the English were satisfied with carefully prepared plaster-cast copies and the original remained at the site, part of the Bhopal state
The rulers of Bhopal, Shahjehan Begum and her successor Sultan Jehan Begum, provided money for the preservation of the ancient site
No wonder then that John Marshall dedicated his important volumes on Sanchi to Sultan Jehan
She funded the museum that was built there as well as the guesthouse where he lived and wrote the volumes
She also funded the publication of the volumes
So if the stupa complex has survived, it is in no small measure due to wise decisions, and to good luck in escaping the eyes of railway contractors, builders, and those looking for finds to carry away to the museums of Europe
One of the most important Buddhist centres, the discovery of Sanchi has vastly transformed our understanding of early Buddhism
Today it stands testimony to the successful restoration and preservation of a key archaeological site by the Archaeological Survey of India .Fig
4.3 The Great Stupa at Sanchi If you travel from Delhi to Bhopal by train, you will see the majestic stupa complex on top of a hill, crowning it as it were
If you request the guard he will stop the train at the little station of Sanchi for two minutes – enough time for you to get down
As you climb up the hill you can see the complex of structures: a large mound and other monuments including a temple built in the fifth century
THINKERS , BELIEFS AND BUILDINGS THEMES IN INDIAN HISTORY But what is the significance of this monument? Why was the mound built and what did it contain? Why is there a stone railing around it? Who built the complex or paid for its construction? When was it “discovered”? There is a fascinating story that we can uncover at Sanchi for which we must combine information from texts, sculpture, architecture and inscriptions
Let us begin by exploring the background of the early Buddhist tradition
2
The Bac kground: Sacrifices and Debates The mid-first millennium BCE is often regarded as a turning point in world history: it saw the emergence of thinkers such as Zarathustra in Iran, Kong Zi in China, Socrates, Plato and Aristotle in Greece, and Mahavira and Gautama Buddha, among many others, in India
They tried to understand the mysteries of existence and the relationship between human beings and the cosmic order
This was also the time when new kingdoms and cities were developing and social and economic life was changing in a variety of ways in the Ganga valley (Chapters 2 and 3)
These thinkers attempted to understand these developments as well
2.1 The sacrificial tradition There were several pre-existing traditions of thought, religious belief and practice, including the early Vedic tradition, known from the Rigveda , compiled between c.1500 and 1000 BCE
The Rigveda consists of hymns in praise of a variety of deities, especially Agni, Indra and Soma
Many of these hymns were chanted when sacrifices were performed, where people prayed for cattle, sons, good health, long life, etc
At first, sacrifices were performed collectively
Later ( c
1000 BCE-500 BCE onwards) some were performed by the heads of households for the well- being of the domestic unit
More elaborate sacrifices, such as the rajasuya and ashvamedha , were performed by chiefs and kings who depended on Brahmana priests to conduct the ritual
2.2 New questions Many ideas found in the Upanishads ( c
sixth century BCE onwards) show that people were curious about the meaning of life, the possibility of life after death,A prayer to Agni Here are two verses from the Rigveda invoking Agni, the god of fire, often identified with the sacrificial fire, into which offerings were made so as to reach the other deities: Bring, O strong one, this sacrifice of ours to the gods, O wise one, as a liberal giver
Bestow on us, O priest, abundant food
Agni, obtain, by sacrificing, mighty wealth for us
Procure, O Agni, for ever to him who prays to you (the gift of) nourishment, the wonderful cow
May a son be ours, offspring that continues our line Verses such as these wer e composed in a special kind of Sanskrit, known as V edic Sanskrit
They were taught orally to men belonging to priestly families.Ü Discuss..
Compare what Shahjehan Begum described with what you see in Fig
4.3
What similarities and differences do you notice? Ü List the objectives of the sacrifice.Source 1 and rebirth
Was rebirth due to past actions? Such issues were hotly debated
Thinkers were concerned with understanding and expressing the nature of the ultimate reality
And others, outside the Vedic tradition, asked whether or not there even was a single ultimate reality
People also began speculating on the significance of the sacrificial tradition
2.3 Debates and discussions We get a glimpse of lively discussions and debates from Buddhist texts, which mention as many as sects or schools of thought
Teachers travelled from place to place, trying to convince one another as well as laypersons, about the validity of their philosophy or the way they understood the world
Debates took place in the kutagarashala – literally, a hut with a pointed roof – or in groves where travelling mendicants halted
If a philosopher succeeded in convincing one of his rivals, the followers of the latter also became his disciples
So support for any particular sect could grow and shrink over time
Many of these teachers, including Mahavira and the Buddha, questioned the authority of the Vedas
They also emphasised individual agency – suggesting that men and women could strive to attain liberation from the trials and tribulations of worldly existence
This was in marked contrast to the Brahmanical position, wherein, as we have seen, an individual’s existence was thought to be determined by his or her birth in a specific caste or gender
Verses from the Upanishads Here are two verses from the Chhandogya Upanishad, a text composed in Sanskrit c
sixth century BCE: The nature of the self This self of mine within the heart, is smaller than paddy or barley or mustard or millet or the kernel of a seed of millet
This self of mine within the heart is greater than the earth, greater than the intermediate space, greater than heaven, greater than these worlds
The true sacrifice This one (the wind) that blows, this is surely a sacrifice While moving, it sanctifies all this; therefore it is indeed a sacrifice.Source 2THINKERS , BELIEFS AND BUILDINGS THEMES IN INDIAN HISTORY How Buddhist texts were prepared and preserved The Buddha (and other teachers) taught orally  through discussion and debate
Men and women (perhaps children as well) attended these discourses and discussed what they heard
None of the Buddhas speeches were written down during his lifetime
After his death ( c
fifth-fourth century BCE) his teachings were compiled by his disciples at a council of elders or senior monks at V esali (P ali for V aishali in pr esent-day Bihar)
These compilations were known as Tipitaka  literally , three bask ets to hold differ ent types of texts
They were first transmitted orally and then written and classified accor ding to length as well as subject matter
The Vinaya P itaka included rules and r egulations for those who joined the sangha or monastic order; the Buddhas teachings were included in the Sutta Pitaka ; and the Abhidhamma P itaka dealt with philosophical matters
Each pitaka comprised a number of individual te xts
L ater, commentaries wer e written on these texts by Buddhist scholars
As Buddhism travelled to new r egions such as Sri L anka, other te xts such as the Dipavamsa (literally , the chr onicle of the island) and Mahavamsa (the great chronicle) were written, containing regional histories of Buddhism
Many of these works contained biographies of the Buddha
Some of the oldest texts are in Pali, while later compositions are in Sanskrit
When Buddhism spr ead to East Asia, pilgrims such as F a Xian and Xuan Zang travelled all the way from China to India in search of texts
These they took back to their own country , wher e they wer e translated by scholars
Indian Buddhist teachers also travelled to faraway places, carrying texts to disseminate the teachings of the Buddha
Buddhist texts were preserved in manuscripts for several centuries in monasteries in different parts of Asia
Modern translations have been prepared from Pali, Sanskrit, Chinese and Tibetan texts
Fig
4.4 A Buddhist manuscript in Sanskrit, c
twelfth century Fatalists and materialists? Here is an e xcerpt fr om the Sutta P itaka , describing a conversation between king Ajatasattu, the ruler of Magadha, and the Buddha: On one occasion King Ajatasattu visited the Buddha and described what another teacher , named Makkhali Gosala, had told him: Though the wise should hope, by this virtue by this penance I will gain karma and the fool should by the same means hope to gradually rid himself of his karma, neither of them can do it
Pleasure and pain, measured out as it were, cannot be altered in the course of samsara (transmigration)
It can neither be lessened or increased just as a ball of string will when thrown unwind to its full length, so fool and wise alike will tak e their course and mak e an end of sorr ow. And this is what a philosopher named Ajita Kesakambalin taught: Ther e is no such thing, O king, as alms or sacrifice, or offerings there is no such thing as this world or the next A human being is made up of the four elements
When he dies the earthy in him returns to the earth, the fluid to water , the heat to fir e, the windy to air , and his senses pass into space The talk of gifts is a doctrine of fools, an empty lie fools and wise alike are cut off and perish
They do not survive after death. The first teacher belonged to the tradition of the Ajivikas
They have often been described as fatalists: those who believe that everything is predetermined
The second teacher belonged to the tradition of the Lokayatas, usually described as materialists
T exts from these traditions have not survived, so we know about them only from the works of other traditions
Ü Discuss..
What are the problems in reconstructing histories of ideas and beliefs when texts are not available or have not survived?Ü Do you think it is appropriate to describe these men as fatalists or materialists?Source 3THINKERS , BELIEFS AND BUILDINGS THEMES IN INDIAN HISTORY 3.Beyond W orldly Pleasur es The Messag e of Maha vira The basic philosophy of the Jainas was already in existence in north India before the birth of Vardhamana, who came to be known as Mahavira, in the sixth century BCE
According to Jaina tradition, Mahavira was preceded by other teachers or tirthankaras – literally, those who guide men and women across the river of existence
The most important idea in Jainism is that the entire world is animated: even stones, rocks and water have life
Non-injury to living beings, especially to humans, animals, plants and insects, is central to Jaina philosophy
In fact the principle of ahimsa, emphasised within Jainism, has left its mark on Indian thinking as a whole
According to Jaina teachings, the cycle of birth and rebirth is shaped through karma
Asceticism and penance are required to free oneself from the cycle of karma
This can be achieved only by renouncing the world; therefore, monastic existence is a necessary condition of salvation
Jaina monks and nuns took five vows: to abstain from killing, stealing and lying; to observe celibacy; and to abstain from possessing property
The world beyond the palace Just as the Buddhas teachings were compiled by his followers, the teachings of Mahavira were also recorded by his disciples
These were often in the form of stories, which could appeal to ordinary people
Here is one example, from a Prakrit text known as the Uttaradhyayana Sutta, describing how a queen named Kamalavati tried to persuade her husband to renounce the world: If the whole world and all its treasures were yours, you would not be satisfied, nor would all this be able to save you
When you die, O king and leave all things behind, dhamma alone, and nothing else, will save you
As a bird dislikes the cage, so do I dislike (the world)
I shall live as a nun without offspring, without desire, without the love of gain, and without hatred Those who have enjoyed pleasures and renounced them, move about like the wind, and go wherever they please, unchecked like birds in their flight Leave your large kingdom abandon what pleases the senses, be without attachment and pr operty , then practise sever e penance, being firm of ener gy Fig

Like the Buddhists, Jaina scholars produced a wealth of literature in a variety of languages – Prakrit, Sanskrit and Tamil
For centuries, manuscripts of these texts were carefully preserved in libraries attached to temples
Some of the earliest stone sculptures associated with religious traditions were produced by devotees of the Jaina tirthankaras , and have been recovered from several sites throughout the subcontinent
4.The Buddha and the Quest for Enlightenment One of the most influential teachers of the time was the Buddha
Over the centuries, his message spread across the subcontinent and beyond – through Central Asia to China, Korea and Japan, and through Sri Lanka, across the seas to Myanmar, Thailand and Indonesia
How do we know about the Buddha’s teachings? These have been reconstructed by carefully editing, translating and analysing the Buddhist texts mentioned earlier
Historians have also tried to reconstruct details of his life from hagiographies
Many of these were written down at least a century after the time of the Buddha, in an attempt to preserve memories of the great teacher
According to these traditions, Siddhartha, as the Buddha was named at birth, was the son of a chiefÜ Discuss..
Is ahimsa relevant in the twenty-first century? Hagiography is a biography of a saint or religious leader
Hagiographies often praise the saint’s achievements, and may not always be literally accurate
They are important because they tell us about the beliefs of the followers of that particular tradition

One day he persuaded his charioteer to take him into the city
His first journey into the world outside was traumatic
He was deeply anguished when he saw an old man, a sick man and a corpse
He realised in that moment that the decay and destruction of the human body was inevitable
He also saw a homeless mendicant, who, it seemed to him, had come to terms with old age, disease and death, and found peace
Siddhartha decided that he too would adopt the same path
Soon after, he left the palace and set out in search of his own truth
Siddhartha explored several paths including bodily mortification which led him to a situation of near death
Abandoning these extreme methods, he meditated for several days and finally attained enlightenment
After this he came to be known as the Buddha or the Enlightened One
For the rest of his life, he taught dhamma or the path of righteous living.Fig

If you did not know about the life of the Buddha, would you be able to tell what the sculpture depicts? 5
The Teachings of the Buddha The Buddha’s teachings have been reconstructed from stories, found mainly in the Sutta Pitaka
Although some stories describe his miraculous powers, others suggest that the Buddha tried to convince people through reason and persuasion rather than through displays of supernatural power
For instance, when a grief-stricken woman whose child had died came to the Buddha, he gently convinced her about the inevitability of death rather than bring her son back to life
These stories were narrated in the language spoken by ordinary people so that these could be easily understood
According to Buddhist philosophy, the world is transient ( anicca ) and constantly changing; it is also soulless ( anatta ) as there is nothing permanent or eternal in it
Within this transient world, sorrow ( dukkha ) is intrinsic to human existence
It is by following the path of moderation between severe penance and self-indulgence that human beings can rise above these worldly troubles
In the earliest forms of Buddhism, whether or not god existed was irrelevant
Buddhism in practice This is an e xcerpt fr om the Sutta P itaka , and contains the advice given by the Buddha to a wealthy householder named Sigala: In five ways should a master look after his servants and employees by assigning them work according to their strength, by supplying them with food and wages, by tending them in sickness; by sharing delicacies with them and by granting leave at times In five ways should the clansmen look after the needs of samanas (those who have renounced the world) and Brahmanas: by affection in act and speech and mind, by keeping open house to them and supplying their worldly needs
There are similar instructions to Sigala about how to behave with his parents, teacher and wife
Ü Suggest what the instructions regarding parents, teacher and wife may have been.Source 5THINKERS , BELIEFS AND BUILDINGS THEMES IN INDIAN HISTORY The Buddha regarded the social world as the creation of humans rather than of divine origin
Therefore, he advised kings and gahapatis (see also Chapter 2) to be humane and ethical
Individual effort was expected to transform social relations
The Buddha emphasised individual agency and righteous action as the means to escape from the cycle of rebirth and attain self-realisation and nibbana , literally the extinguishing of the ego and desire – and thus end the cycle of suffering for those who renounced the world
According to Buddhist tradition, his last words to his followers were: “Be lamps unto yourselves as all of you must work out your own liberation.” 6
F ollo wers of t he Buddha Soon there grew a body of disciples of the Buddha and he founded a sangha , an organisation of monks who too became teachers of dhamma
These monks lived simply, possessing only the essential requisites for survival, such as a bowl to receive food once a day from the laity
As they lived on alms, they were known as bhikkhus
Initially, only men were allowed into the sangha , but later women also came to be admitted
According to Buddhist texts, this was made possible through the mediation of Ananda, one of the Buddha’s dearest disciples, who persuaded him to allow women into the sangha
The Buddha’s foster mother, Mahapajapati Gotami was the first woman to be ordained as a bhikkhuni
Many women who entered the sangha became teachers of dhamma and went on to become theris , or respected women who had attained liberation
The Buddha’s followers came from many social groups
They included kings, wealthy men and gahapatis , and also humbler folk: workers, slaves and craftspeople
Once within the sangha , all were regarded as equal, having shed their earlier social identities on becoming bhikkhus and bhikkhunis
The internal functioning of the sangha was based on the traditions of ganas and sanghas, where consensus was arrived at through discussions
If that failed, decisions were taken by a vote on the subject.Ü Discuss..
Compare the Buddha’s advice to Sigala with Asoka’s advice to his subjects (Chapter 2)
Do you notice any similarities and differences? The Therigatha This unique Buddhist te xt, part of the Sutta P itaka , is a collection of verses composed by bhikkhunis
It provides an insight into women s social and spiritual e xperiences
Punna, a dasi or slave woman, went to the river each morning to fetch water for her masters household
There she would daily see a Brahmana performing bathing rituals
One morning she spoke to him
The following are verses composed by Punna, recording her conversation with the Brahmana: I am a water carrier: Even in the cold I have always gone down to the water frightened of punishment Or the angry words of high class women
So what are you afraid of Brahmana , That makes you go down to the water (Though) your limbs shake with the bitter cold? The Brahmana replied: I am doing good to prevent evil; anyone young or old who has done something bad is freed by washing in water
Punna said: Whoever told you You ar e freed fr om evil by washing in the water? In that case all the frogs and turtles Would go to heaven, and so would the water snak es and crocodiles! (Instead) Don t do that thing, the fear of which leads you to the water

If after less than six years he should have another new felt (blanket/rug) made, regardless of whether or not he has disposed of the first, then  unless he has been authorised by the bhikkhus  it is to be forfeited and confessed
In case a bhikkhu arriving at a family residence is presented with cakes or cooked grain-meal, he may accept two or three bowlfuls if he so desires
If he should accept more than that, it is to be confessed
Having accepted the two or three bowlfuls and having taken them from there, he is to share them among the bhikkhus
This is the proper course here
Should any bhikkhu , having set out bedding in a lodging belonging to the sangha  or having had it set out  and then on departing neither put it away nor have it put away , or should he go without taking leave, it is to be confessed
Buddhism grew rapidly both during the lifetime of the Buddha and after his death, as it appealed to many people dissatisfied with existing religious practices and confused by the rapid social changes taking place around them
The importance attached to conduct and values rather than claims of superiority based on birth, the emphasis placed on metta (fellow feeling) and karuna (compassion), especially for those who were younger and weaker than oneself, were ideas that drew men and women to Buddhist teachings.Ü Can you explain why these rules were framed?

Stupas We have seen that Buddhist ideas and practices emerged out of a process of dialogue with other traditions – including those of the Brahmanas, Jainas and several others, not all of whose ideas and practices were preserved in texts
Some of these interactions can be seen in the ways in which sacred places came to be identified
From earliest times, people tended to regard certain places as sacred
These included sites with special trees or unique rocks, or sites of awe- inspiring natural beauty
These sites, with small shrines attached to them, were sometimes described as chaityas
Buddhist literature mentions several chaityas
It also describes places associated with theChaitya may also have been derived from the word chita, meaning a funeral pyre, and by extension a funerary mound.THINKERS , BELIEFS AND BUILDINGS Map 1 Major Buddhist sites Sketch map not to scaleBAY OF BENGALARABIAN SEA AmaravatiNagarjunakondaNasik Junnar KarleAjantaSanchiBharhutBodh GayaBarabarIndusYamunaGanga Narmada GodavariMahanadi Krishna KrishnaShravastiLumbini Kusinagara Sarnath THEMES IN INDIAN HISTORY Ü Look at Fig

and see whether you can identify some of these practices.Buddha’ s life – where he was born (Lumbini), where he attained enlightenment (Bodh Gaya), where he gave his first sermon (Sarnath) and where he attained nibbana (Kusinagara)
Gradually, each of these places came to be regarded as sacred
We know that about 200 years after the time of the Buddha, Asoka erected a pillar at Lumbini to mark the fact that he had visited the place
7.1 Why were stupas built? There were other places too that were regarded as sacred
This was because relics of the Buddha such as his bodily remains or objects used by him were buried there
These were mounds known as stupas
The tradition of erecting stupas may have been pre-Buddhist, but they came to be associated with Buddhism
Since they contained relics regarded as sacred, the entire stupa came to be venerated as an emblem of both the Buddha and Buddhism
According to a Buddhist text known as the Ashokavadana , Asoka distributed portions of the Buddha’s relics to every important town and ordered the construction of stupas over them
By the second century BCE a number of stupas , including those at Bharhut, Sanchi and Sarnath (Map 1), had been built
7.2 How were stupas built? Inscriptions found on the railings and pillars of stupas record donations made for building and decorating them
Some donations were made by kings such as the Satavahanas; others were made by guilds, such as that of the ivory workers who financed part of one of the gateways at Sanchi
Hundreds of donations were made by women and men who mention their names, sometimes adding the name of the place from where they came, as well as their occupations and names of their relatives
Bhikkhus and bhikkhunis also contributed towards building these monuments
7.3 The structure of the stupa The stupa (a Sanskrit word meaning a heap) originated as a simple semi-circular mound of earth, later called anda
Gradually, it evolved into a more complex structure, balancing round and square shapes
A bove the anda was the harmika , a balcony- like structure that represented the abode of the gods.Why were stupas built? This is an excerpt from the Mahaparinibbana Sutta , part of the Sutta P itaka: As the Buddha lay dying, Ananda asked him: “What are we to do Lord, with the remains of the Tathagata (another name for the Buddha)?” The Buddha replied: “Hinder not yourselves Ananda by honouring the remains of the T athagata
Be zealous, be intent on your own good.” But when pr essed further , the Buddha said: “At the four cr ossroads they should erect a thupa (Pali for stupa) to the Tathagata
And whosoever shall there place garlands or perfume ..
or make a salutation there, or become in its presence calm of heart, that shall long be to them for a profit and joy .”Source 8 Fig

What are the similarities and differences between the plan of the Great Stupa, Sanchi (Fig
4.a) and the photograph (Fig
4.3)? Arising from the harmika was a mast called the yashti , often surmounted by a chhatri or umbrella
Around the mound was a railing, separating the sacred space from the secular world
The early stupas at Sanchi and Bharhut were plain except for the stone railings, which resembled a bamboo or wooden fence, and the gateways, which were richly carved and installed at the four cardinal points
Worshippers entered through the eastern gateway and walked around the mound in a clockwise direction keeping the mound on the right, imitating the sun’s course through the sky
Later, the mound of the stupas came to be elaborately carved with niches and sculptures as at Amaravati, and Shah- ji-ki-Dheri in Peshawar (Pakistan).THINKERS , BELIEFS AND BUILDINGS THEMES IN INDIAN HISTORY 8
Disco vering S tupas The F ate of Amar avati and Sanc hi Each stupa has a history of its own – as we have just seen, some of these are histories of how they were built
But there are histories of discoveries as well, and let us now turn to some of these
In 1796, a local raja who wanted to build a temple stumbled upon the ruins of the stupa at Amaravati
He decided to use the stone, and thought there might be some treasure buried in what seemed to be a hill
Some years later, a British official named Colin Mackenzie (see also Chapter 7) visited the site
Although he found several pieces of sculpture and made detailed drawings of them, these reports were never published
In 1854, Walter Elliot, the commissioner of Guntur (Andhra Pradesh), visited Amaravati and collected several sculpture panels and took them away to Madras
(These came to be called the Elliot marbles after him.) He also discovered the remains of the western gateway and came to the conclusion that the structure at Amaravati was one of the largest and most magnificent Buddhist stupas ever built
By the 1850s, some of the slabs from Amaravati had begun to be taken to different places: to the Asiatic Society of Bengal at Calcutta, to the India Office in Madras and some even to London
It was not unusual to find these sculptures adorning the gardens of British administrators
In fact, any new official in the area continued to remove sculptures from the site on the grounds that earlier officials had done the same
One of the few men who had a different point of view was an archaeologist named H.H
Cole
He wrote: “It seems to me a suicidal and indefensible policy to allow the country to be looted of original works of ancient art.” He believed that museums should have plaster-cast facsimiles of sculpture, whereas the originals should remainFig
4
The eastern gateway, Sanchi Notice the vibrant sculpture
where they had been found
Unfortunately, Cole did not succeed in convincing the authorities about Amaravati, although his plea for in situ preservation was adopted in the case of Sanchi
Why did Sanchi survive while Amaravati did not? Perhaps Amaravati was discovered before scholars understood the value of the finds and realised how critical it was to preserve things where they had been found instead of removing them from the site
When Sanchi was “discovered” in 1818, three of its four gateways were still standing, the fourth was lying on the spot where it had fallen and the mound was in good condition
Even so, it was suggested that the gateway be taken to either Paris or London; finally a number of factors helped to keep Sanchi as it was, and so it stands, whereas the mahachaitya at Amaravati is now just an insignificant little mound, totally denuded of its former glory
9
Sculpture We have just seen how sculptures were removed from stupas and transported all the way to Europe
This happened partly because those who saw them considered them to be beautiful and valuable, and wanted to keep them for themselves
Let us look at some of these more closely
9.1 Stories in stone You may have seen wandering storytellers carrying scrolls ( charanachitras ) of cloth or paper with pictures on them and pointing to the pictures as they tell the story
Look at Figure 4.
At first sight the sculpture seems to depict a rural scene, with thatched huts and trees
However, art historians who have carefully studied the sculpture at Sanchi identify it as a scene from the Vessantara Jataka
This is a story about a generous prince who gave away everything to a Brahmana, and went to live in the forest with his wife and children
As you can see in thisIn situ means on the spot.Ü Discuss..

9.2 Symbols of worship Art historians had to acquire familiarity with hagiographies of the Buddha in order to understand Buddhist sculpture
According to hagiographies, the Buddha attained enlightenment while meditating under a tree
Many early sculptors did not show the Buddha in human form – instead, they showed his presence through symbols
The empty seat (Fig
4.) was meant to indicate the meditation of the Buddha, and the stupa (Fig
4.) was meant to represent the mahaparinibbana
Another frequently used symbol was the wheel (Fig
4.)
This stood for the first sermon of the Buddha, delivered at Sarnath
As is obvious, such sculptures cannot be understood literally – for instance, the tree does not standFig

(middle right) Worshipping the stupa Fig

(below) Setting in motion the wheel of dharma 101 simply for a tree, but symbolises an event in the life of the Buddha
In order to understand such symbols, historians have to familiarise themselves with the traditions of those who produced these works of art
9.3 Popular traditions Other sculptures at Sanchi were perhaps not directly inspired by Buddhist ideas
These include beautiful women swinging from the edge of the gateway, holding onto a tree (Fig
4.)
Initially, scholars were a bit intrigued about this image, which seemed to have little to do with renunciation
However, after examining other literary traditions, they realised that it could be a representation of what is described in Sanskrit as a shalabhanjika
According to popular belief, this was a woman whose touch caused trees to flower and bear fruit
It is likely that this was regarded as an auspicious symbol and integrated into the decoration of the stupa
The shalabhanjika motif suggests that many people who turned to Buddhism enriched it with their own pre-Buddhist and even non-Buddhist beliefs, practices and ideas
Some of the recurrent motifs in the sculpture at Sanchi were evidently derived from these traditions
There are other images as well
For instance, some of the finest depictions of animals are found there
These animals include elephants, horses, monkeys and cattle
While the Jatakas contain several animal stories that are depicted at Sanchi, it is likely that many of these animals were carved to create lively scenes to draw viewers
Also, animals were often used as symbols of human attributes
Elephants, for example, were depicted to signify strength and wisdom.Fig

The woman at the gateTHINKERS , BELIEFS AND BUILDINGS THEMES IN INDIAN HISTORY 102 Paintings from the past While stone sculpture survives the ravages of time and is therefore most easily available to the historian, other visual means of communication, including paintings, were also used in the past
Those that have survived best are on walls of caves, of which those from Ajanta (Maharashtra) are the most famous
The paintings at Ajanta depict stories from the Jatakas
These include depictions of courtly life, processions, men and women at work, and festivals
The artists used the technique of shading to give a thr ee-dimensional quality
Some of the paintings are extremely naturalistic
Another motif is that of a woman surrounded by lotuses and elephants (Fig
4.), which seem to be sprinkling water on her as if performing an abhisheka or consecration
While some historians identify the figure as Maya, the mother of the Buddha, others identify her with a popular goddess, Gajalakshmi – literally, the goddess of good fortune – who is associated with elephants
It is also possible thatFig

Gajalakshmi Fig
4
A painting from Ajanta Note the seated figure and those serving him
103 devotees who saw these sculptures identified the figure with both Maya and Gajalakshmi
Consider, too, the serpent, which is found on several pillars (Fig
4.)
This motif seems to be derived from popular traditions, which were not always recorded in texts
Interestingly, one of the earliest modern art historians, James Fergusson, considered Sanchi to be a centre of tree and serpent worship
He was not familiar with Buddhist literature – most of which had not yet been translated – and arrived at this conclusion by studying only the images on their own
N ew R eligious T raditions .1 The development of Mahayana Buddhism By the first century CE, there is evidence of changes in Buddhist ideas and practices
Early Buddhist teachings had given great importance to self-effort in achieving nibbana
Besides, the Buddha was regarded as a human being who attained enlightenment and nibbana through his own efforts
However, gradually the idea of a saviour emerged
It was believed that he was the one who could ensure salvation
Simultaneously, the concept of the Bodhisatta also developed
Bodhisattas were perceived as deeply compassionate beings who accumulated merit through their efforts but used this not to attain nibbana and thereby abandon the world, but to help others
The worship of images of the Buddha and Bodhisattas became an important part of this tradition
This new way of thinking was called Mahayana – literally, the “great vehicle”
Those who adopted these beliefs described the older tradition as Hinayana or the “lesser vehicle”.Ü Discuss..

However , followers of the older tradition described themselves as theravadins , that is, those who followed the path of old, respected teachers, the theras .THINKERS , BELIEFS AND BUILDINGS THEMES IN INDIAN HISTORY 104 .2 The growth of Puranic Hinduism The notion of a saviour was not unique to Buddhism
We find similar ideas being developed in different ways within traditions that we now consider part of Hinduism
These included Vaishnavism (a form of Hinduism within which Vishnu was worshipped as the principal deity) and Shaivism (a tradition within which Shiva was regarded as the chief god), in which there was growing emphasis on the worship of a chosen deity
In such worship the bond between the devotee and the god was visualised as one of love and devotion, or bhakti
In the case of Vaishnavism , cults developed around the various avatars or incarnations of the deity
Ten avatars were recognised within the tradition
These were forms that the deity was believed to have assumed in order to save the world when ever it was threatened by disorder and destruction because of the dominance of evil forces
It is likely that different avatars were popular in different parts of the country
Recognising each of these local deities as a form of Vishnu was one way of creating a more unified religious tradition
Some of these forms were represented in sculptures, as were other deities
Shiva, for instance, was symbolised by the linga, although he was occasionally represented in human form too
All such representations depicted a complex set of ideas about the deities and their attributes through symbols such as head- dresses, ornaments and ayudhas – weapons or auspicious objects the deities hold in their hands – how they are seated, etc
To understand the meanings of these sculptures historiansFig

The Varaha or boar avatar of Vishnu rescuing the earth goddess, Aihole (Karnataka) c
sixth century CE Ü What does the proportion of the figures suggest? 105 have to be familiar with the stories behind them – many of which are contained in the Puranas , compiled by Brahmanas (by about the middle of the first millennium CE)
They contained much that had been composed and been in circulation for centuries, including stories about gods and goddesses
Generally, they were written in simple Sanskrit verse, and were meant to be read aloud to everybody, including women and Shudras, who did not have access to Vedic learning
Much of what is contained in the Puranas evolved through interaction amongst people – priests, merchants, and ordinary men and women who travelled from place to place sharing ideas and beliefs
We know for instance that Vasudeva-Krishna was an important deity in the Mathura region
Over centuries, his worship spread to other parts of the country as well
.3 Building temples Around the time that the stupas at sites such as Sanchi were acquiring their present form, the first temples to house images of gods and goddesses were also being built
The early temple was a small square room, called the garbhagriha , with a single doorway for the worshipper to enter and offer worship to the image
Gradually, a tall structure, known as theFig

Temple walls were often decorated with sculpture
Later temples became far more elaborate – with assembly halls, huge walls and gateways, and arrangements for supplying water (see also Chapter 7)
One of the unique features of early temples was that some of these were hollowed out of huge rocks, as artificial caves
The tradition of building artificial caves was an old one

fifth century CE 107 of these were constructed in the third century BCE on the orders of Asoka for renouncers who belonged to the Ajivika sect
This tradition evolved through various stages and culminated much later – in the eighth century – in the carving out of an entire temple, that of Kailashnatha (a name of Shiva)
A copperplate inscription records the amazement of the chief sculptor after he completed the temple at Ellora: “Oh how did I make it!” 1 1
Can W e See Ev erything? By now you have had a glimpse of the rich visual traditions that existed in the past – expressed in brick and stone architecture, sculpture and painting
We have seen that much has been destroyed and lost over the centuries
Nevertheless, what remains and has been preserved conveys a sense of the vision of the artists, sculptors, masons and architects who created these spectacular works
Yet, do we always automatically understand what they wanted to convey? Can we ever know what these images meant to people who saw them and venerated them about 2,000 years ago? .1 Grappling with the unfamiliar It will be useful to recall that when nineteenth- century European scholars first saw some of the sculptures of gods and goddesses, they could not understand what these were about
Sometimes, they were horrified by what seemed to them grotesqueFig

These early scholars tried to make sense of what appeared to be strange images by comparing them with sculpture with which they were familiar, that from ancient Greece
While they often found early Indian sculpture inferior to the works of Greek artists, they were very excited when they discovered images of the Buddha and Bodhisattas that were evidently based on Greek models
These were, more often than not, found in the northwest, in cities such as Taxila and Peshawar, where Indo-Greek rulers had established kingdoms in the second century BCE
As these images were closest to the Greek statues these scholars were familiar with, they were considered to be the best examples of early Indian art
In effect, these scholars adopted a strategy we all frequently use – devising yardsticks derived from the familiar to make sense of the unfamiliar
.2 If text and image do not match ..
Consider another problem
We have seen that art historians often draw upon textual traditions to understand the meaning of sculptures
While this is certainly a far more efficacious strategy than comparing Indian images with Greek statues, it is not always easy to use
One of the most intriguing examples of this is a famous sculpture along a huge rock surface in Mahabalipuram (Tamil Nadu)
Clearly, Fig
4
is a vivid depiction of a story
But which story is it? Art historians have searched through the Puranas to identify it and are sharply divided in their opinions
Some feel that this depicts the descent of the river Ganga from heaven – the Fig
4
A Bodhisatta from Gandhara Note the clothes and the hairstyle
109 natural cleft through the centre of the rock surface might represent the river
The story itself is narrated in the Puranas and the epics
Others feel that it represents a story from the Mahabharata – Arjuna doing penance on the river bank in order to acquire arms – pointing to the central figure of an ascetic
Finally, remember that many rituals, religious beliefs and practices were not recorded in a permanent, visible form – as monuments, or sculpture, or even paintings
These included daily practices, as well as those associated with special occasions
Many communities and peoples may not have felt the need for keeping lasting records, even as they may have had vibrant traditions of religious activities and philosophical ideas
In fact, the spectacular instances we have focused on in this chapter are just the tip of the iceberg

4.4, 4.6, 4.7, 4.: National Museum, New Delhi In the previous chapter we saw that there were several changes in economic and political life between c
600 BCE and 600 CE
Some of these changes influenced societies as well
For instance, the extension of agriculture into forested areas transformed the lives of forest dwellers; craft specialists often emerged as distinct social groups; the unequal distribution of wealth sharpened social differences
Historians often use textual traditions to understand these processes
Some texts lay down norms of social behaviour; others describe and occasionally comment on a wide range of social situations and practices
W e can also catch a glimpse of some social actors from inscriptions
As we will see, each text (and inscription) was written from the perspective of specific social categories
So we need to keep in mind who composed what and for whom
We also need to consider the language used, and the ways in which the text circulated
Used carefully, texts allow us to piece together attitudes and practices that shaped social histories
In focusing on the Mahabharata , a colossal epic running in its present form into over 100,000 verses with depictions of a wide range of social categories and situations, we draw on one of the richest texts of the subcontinent
It was composed over a period of about 1,000 years ( c
500 BCE onwards), and some of the stories it contains may have been in cir culation even earlier
The central story is about two sets of warring cousins
The text also contains sections laying down norms of behaviour for various social groups

The Cr itical Edition of t he Mahabhar ata One of the most ambitious projects of scholarship began in 1919, under the leadership of a noted Indian Sanskritist, V.S
Sukthankar
A team comprising dozens of scholars initiated the task of preparing a critical edition of the Mahabharata
What exactly did this involve? Initially, it meant collecting Sanskrit manuscripts of the text, written in a variety of scripts, from different parts of the country
The team worked out a method of comparing verses from each manuscript
Ultimately, they selected the verses that appeared common to most versions and published these in several volumes, running into over ,000 pages
The project took years to complete
Two things became apparent: there were several common elements in the Sanskrit versions of the story, evident in manuscripts found all over the subcontinent, from Kashmir and Nepal in the north to Kerala and Tamil Nadu in the south
Also evident were enormous regional variations in the ways in which the text had been transmitted over the centuries
These variations were documented in footnotes and appendices to the main text
Taken together, more than half the ,000 pages are devoted to these variations
In a sense, these variations are reflective of the complex processes that shaped early (and later) social histories – through dialogues between dominant traditions and resilient local ideas and practices
These dialogues are characterised by moments of conflict as well as consensus
Our understanding of these processes is derived primarily from texts written in Sanskrit by and for Brahmanas
When issues of social history were explored for the first time by historians in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, they tended to take these texts at face value – believing that everything that was laid down in these texts was actually practised
Subsequently, scholars began studying other traditions, from works in Pali, Prakrit and Tamil
These studies indicated that the ideas contained in normative Sanskrit texts were on the whole recognised as authoritative: they were also questioned and occasionally even rejected
It is important to keep this in mind as we examine how historians reconstruct social histories

Kinship and Marriage Man y Rules and V aried Pr actices 2.1 Finding out about families We often take family life for granted
However, you may have noticed that not all families are identical: they vary in terms of numbers of members, their relationship with one another as well as the kinds of activities they share
Often people belonging to the same family share food and other resources, and live, work and perform rituals together
Families are usually parts of larger networks of people defined as relatives, or to use a more technical term, kinfolk
While familial ties are often regarded as “natural” and based on blood, they are defined in many different ways
For instance, some societies regard cousins as being blood relations, whereas others do not
For early societies, historians can retrieve information about elite families fairly easily; it is, however, far more difficult to reconstruct the familial relationships of ordinary people
Historians also investigate and analyse attitudes towards family and kinship
These are important, because they provide an insight into people’s thinking; it is likely that some of these ideas would have shaped their actions, just as actions may have led to changes in attitudes
2.2 The ideal of patriliny Can we identify points when kinship relations changed? At one level, the Mahabharata is a story about this
It describes a feud over land and power between two groups of cousins, the Kauravas and the Pandavas, who belonged to a single ruling family, that of the Kurus, a lineage dominating one of the janapadas (Chapter 2, Map 1)
Ultimately, the conflict ended in a battle, in which the Pandavas emerged victorious
After that, patrilineal succession was proclaimed
While patriliny had existed prior to the composition of the epic, the central story of the Mahabharata reinforced the idea that it was valuable
Under patriliny, sons could claim the resources (including the throne in the case of kings) of their fathers when the latter died
Most ruling dynasties ( c
sixth century BCE onwards) claimed to follow this system, although there were variations in practice: sometimes there were no sons,Terms for family and kin Sanskrit texts use the term kula to designate families and jnati for the larger network of kinfolk
The term vamsha is used for lineage
Patriliny means tracing descent from father to son, grandson and so on
Matriliny is the term used when descent is traced through the mother.KINSHIP , CASTE AND CLASS THEMES IN INDIAN HISTORY in some situations brothers succeeded one another, sometimes other kinsmen claimed the throne, and, in very exceptional circumstances, women such as Prabhavati Gupta (Chapter 2) exercised power
The concern with patriliny was not unique to ruling families
It is evident in mantras in ritual texts such as the Rigveda
It is possible that these attitudes were shared by wealthy men and those who claimed high status, including Brahmanas
Producing fine sons Here is an excerpt of a mantra from the Rigveda, which was probably inserted in the text c
1000 BCE, to be chanted by the priest while conducting the marriage ritual
It is used in many Hindu weddings even today: I free her from here, but not from there
I have bound her firmly there, so that through the grace of Indra she will have fine sons and be fortunate in her husbands love
Indra was one of the principal deities , a god of valour , warfar e and rain
Her e and ther e refer to the father s and husbands house r espectively
Ü In the context of the mantra, discuss the implications of marriage from the point of view of the bride and groom
Are the implications identical, or are there differences?Source 1 Sketch map not to scaleKURU Indraprastha SHURASENA MathuraVirata MATSYA Ujjayini AVANTIHastinapura VATSA KaushambiKOSHALAShravasti Ayodhya Sarnath Varanasi Bodh GayaKushinagaraMALLASAKY A LumbiniKapilavastu Pava VaishaliGanga YamunaMap 1 The Kuru Panchala region and neighbouring areas Pataliputra Why kinfolk quarrelled This is an e xcerpt fr om the Adi Parvan (literally , the first section) of the Sanskrit Mahabharata , describing why conflicts arose amongst the Kauravas and Pandavas: The Kauravas were the sons of Dhritarashtra, and the Pandavas were their cousins
Since Dhritarashtra was blind, his younger brother Pandu ascended the throne of Hastinapura (see Map 1) However , after the premature death of Pandu, Dhritarashtra became king, as the royal princes were still very young
As the princes gr ew up together , the citizens of Hastinapura began to express their preference for the Pandavas, for they were more capable and virtuous than the Kauravas
This made Duryodhana, the eldest of the Kauravas, jealous
He approached his father and said, You yourself did not r eceive the thr one, although it fell to you, because of your defect
If the Pandava receives the patrimony from Pandu, his son will surely inherit it in turn, and so will his son, and his
W e ourselves with our sons shall be excluded from the royal succession and become of slight regard in the eyes of the world, lord of the earth! Passages such as these may not have been literally true, but they give us an idea about what those who wrote the text thought
Sometimes, as in this case, they contain conflicting ideas
2.3 Rules of marriage While sons were important for the continuity of the patrilineage, daughters were viewed rather differently within this framework
They had no claims to the resources of the household
At the same time, marrying them into families outside the kin was considered desirable
This system, called exogamy (literally, marrying outside), meant that the lives of young girls and women belonging to families that claimed high status were often carefully regulated to ensure that they were married at the “right” time and to the “right” person
This gave rise to the belief that kanyadana or the gift of a daughter in marriage was an important religious duty of the father
With the emergence of new towns (Chapter 2), social life became more complex
People from nearTypes of marriages Endogamy refers to marriage within a unit  this could be a kin group, caste, or a group living in the same locality

Of these, how important was birth in a particular family? Which of these criteria seem justified? Are there any that strike you as unjust? THEMES IN INDIAN HISTORY Eight forms of marriage Here are the first, fourth, fifth and sixth forms of marriage from the Manusmriti: First: The gift of a daughter , after dressing her in costly clothes and honouring her with presents of jewels, to a man learned in the Veda whom the father himself invites
Fourth: The gift of a daughter by the father after he has addressed the couple with the text, May both of you perform your duties together, and has shown honour to the bridegroom
Fifth: When the bridegroom receives a maiden, after having given as much wealth as he can afford to the kinsmen and to the bride herself, according to his own will
Sixth: The voluntary union of a maiden and her lover which springs from desire and far met to buy and sell their products and share ideas in the urban milieu
This may have led to a questioning of earlier beliefs and practices (see also Chapter 4)
Faced with this challenge, the Brahmanas responded by laying down codes of social behaviour in great detail
These were meant to be followed by Brahmanas in particular and the rest of society in general
From c
500 BCE, these norms were compiled in Sanskrit texts known as the Dharmasutras and Dharmashastras
The most important of such works, the Manusmriti , was compiled between c
200 BCE and 200 CE
While the Brahmana authors of these texts claimed that their point of view had universal validity and that what they prescribed had to be obeyed by everybody, it is likely that real social relations were more complicated
Besides, given the regional diversity within the subcontinent and the difficulties of communication, the influence of Brahmanas was by no means all-pervasive
What is interesting is that the Dharmasutras and Dharmashastras recognised as many as eight forms of marriage
Of these, the first four were considered as “good” while the remaining were condemned
It is possible that these were practised by those who did not accept Brahmanical norms
2.4 The gotra of women One Brahmanical practice, evident from c
1000 BCE onwards, was to classify people (especially Brahmanas) in terms of gotras
Each gotra was named after a Vedic seer, and all those who belonged to the same gotra were regarded as his descendants
Two rules about gotra were particularly important: women were expected to give up their father’s gotra and adopt that of their husband on marriage and members of the same gotra could not marry
One way to find out whether this was commonly followed is to consider the names of men and women, which were sometimes derived from gotra names
These names are available for powerful ruling lineages such as the Satavahanas who ruled over parts of western India and the Deccan ( c
second century BCE-second century CE)
Several of their inscriptions have been recovered, which allow historians to trace family ties, including marriages.Source 3 Ü For each of the forms, discuss whether the decision about the marriage was taken by (a) the bride, (b) the bridegroom, (c) the father of the bride, (d) the father of the bridegroom, (e) any other person

3.3 A Satavahana ruler and his wife This is one of the rare sculptural depictions of a ruler from the wall of a cave donated to Buddhist monks
This sculpture dates to c
second century BCE
Metronymics in the Upanishads The Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, one of the earliest Upanishads (see also Chapter 4), contains a list of successive generations of teachers and students, many of whom were designated by metronymics.Source 4 Ü How many Gotami-putas and how many Vasithi (alternative spelling Vasathi)-putas are there?KINSHIP , CASTE AND CLASS THEMES IN INDIAN HISTORY Some of the Satavahana rulers were polygynous (that is, had more than one wife)
An examination of the names of women who married Satavahana rulers indicates that many of them had names derived from gotras such as Gotama and Vasistha, their father’s gotras
They evidently retained these names instead of adopting names derived from their husband’s gotra name as they were required to do according to the Brahmanical rules
What is also apparent is that some of these women belonged to the same gotra
As is obvious, this ran counter to the ideal of exogamy recommended in the Brahmanical texts
In fact, it exemplified an alternative practice, that of endogamy or marriage within the kin group, which was (and is) prevalent amongst several communities in south India
Such marriages amongst kinfolk (such as cousins) ensured a close-knit community
It is likely that there were variations in other parts of the subcontinent as well, but as yet it has not been possible to reconstruct specific details
2.5 Were mothers important? We have seen that Satavahana rulers were identified through metronymics (names derived from that of the mother)
Although this may suggest that mothers were important, we need to be cautious before we arrive at any conclusion
In the case of the Satavahanas we know that succession to the throne was generally patrilineal

Greed and anger drag a man away from his profits; by defeating these two enemies a king conquers the earth Y ou will happily enjoy the earth, my son, along with the wise and heroic Pandavas There is no good in a war , no law (dharma ) and profit ( artha ), let alone happiness; nor is there (necessarily) victory in the end  don t set your mind on war Duryodhana did not listen to this advice and fought and lost the war
Source 5 Ü Why do you think the Brahmanas quoted this verse frequently?3
Social Differences: Within and Be yond t he F rame work of Caste You are probably familiar with the term caste, which refers to a set of hierarchically ordered social categories
The ideal order was laid down in the Dharmasutras and Dharmashastras
Brahmanas claimed that this order, in which they were ranked first, was divinely ordained, while placing groups classified as Shudras and “untouchables” at the very bottom of the social order
Positions within the order were supposedly determined by birth
3.1 The “right” occupation The Dharmasutras and Dharmashastras also contained rules about the ideal “occupations” of the four categories or varnas
Brahmanas were supposed to study and teach the Vedas, perform sacrifices and get sacrifices performed, and give and receive gifts
Kshatriyas were to engage in warfare, protect people and administer justice, study the Vedas, get sacrifices performed, and make gifts
The last three “occupations” were also assigned to the Vaishyas , who were in addition expected to engage in agriculture, pastoralism and trade
Shudras were assigned only one occupation – that of serving the three “higher” varnas
The Brahmanas evolved two or three strategies for enforcing these norms
One, as we have just seen, was to assert that the varna order was of divine origin
Second, they advised kings to ensure that these norms were followed within their kingdoms
And third, they attempted to persuade people that their status was determined by birth
However, this was not always easy
So prescriptions were often reinforced by stories told in the Mahabharata and other texts.A divine order? To justify their claims, Brahmanas often cited a verse from a hymn in the Rigveda known as the Purusha sukta , describing the sacrifice of Purusha, the primeval man
All the elements of the universe, including the four social categories, were supposed to have emanated from his body: The Brahmana was his mouth, of his arms was made the Kshatriya
His thighs became the Vaishya , of his feet the Shudra was born .Source 6KINSHIP , CASTE AND CLASS THEMES IN INDIAN HISTORY Ü What message do you think this story was meant to convey to the nishadas? What message would it convey to Kshatriyas ? Do you think that Drona, as a Brahmana, was acting according to the Dharmasutras when he was teaching archery?Source 7 Proper social roles Here is a story from the Adi Parvan of the Mahabharata: Once Drona, a Brahmana who taught archery to the Kuru princes, was approached by Ekalavya, a forest- dwelling nishada (a hunting community)
When Drona, who knew the dharma , refused to have him as his pupil, Ekalavya returned to the forest, prepared an image of Drona out of clay , and tr eating it as his teacher , began to practise on his own
In due course, he acquired great skill in ar chery
One day , the Kuru princes went hunting and their dog, wandering in the woods, came upon Ekalavya
When the dog smelt the dark nishada wrapped in black deer skin, his body caked with dirt, it began to bark
Annoyed, Ekalavya shot seven arrows into its mouth
When the dog returned to the Pandavas, they wer e amazed at this superb display of ar chery
They tracked down Ekalavya, who introduced himself as a pupil of Drona
Drona had once told his favourite student Arjuna, that he would be unrivalled amongst his pupils
Arjuna now reminded Drona about this
Drona approached Ekalavya, who immediately acknowledged and honour ed him as his teacher
When Dr ona demanded his right thumb as his fee, Ekalavya unhesitatingly cut it off and offer ed it
But ther eafter , when he shot with his remaining fingers, he was no longer as fast as he had been before
Thus, Drona kept his word: no one was better than Arjuna
3.2 Non-Kshatriya kings According to the Shastras , only Kshatriyas could be kings
However, several important ruling lineages probably had different origins
The social background of the Mauryas, who ruled over a large empire, has been hotly debated
While later Buddhist texts suggested they were Kshatriyas , Brahmanical texts described them as being of “low” origin
The Shungas and Kanvas, the immediate successors of the Mauryas, were Brahmanas
In fact, political power was effectively open to anyone who could muster support and resources, and rarely depended on birth as a Kshatriya
Other rulers, such as the Shakas who came from Central Asia, were regarded as mlechchhas , barbarians or outsiders by the Brahmanas
However, one of the earliest inscriptions in Sanskrit describes how Rudradaman, the best-known Shaka ruler (c
second century CE), rebuilt Sudarshana lake (Chapter 2)
This suggests that powerful mlechchhas were familiar with Sanskritic traditions
It is also interesting that the best-known ruler of the Satavahana dynasty, Gotami-puta Siri-Satakani, claimed to be both a unique Brahmana (eka bamhana) and a destroyer of the pride of Kshatriyas
He also claimed to have ensured that there was no intermarriage amongst members of the four varnas
At the same time, he entered into a marriage alliance with the kin of Rudradaman
As you can see from this example, integration within the framework of caste was often a complicated process
The Satavahanas claimed to be Brahmanas , whereas according to the Brahmanas , kings ought to have been Kshatriyas
They claimed to uphold the fourfold varna order, but entered into marriage alliances with people who were supposed to be excluded from the system
And, as we have seen, they practised endogamy instead of the exogamous system recommended in the Brahmanical texts
3.3 Jatis and social mobility These complexities are reflected in another term used in texts to refer to social categories – jati
In Brahmanical theory, jati, like varna , was based on birth
However, while the number of varnas was fixed at four, there was no restriction on the number of jatis
In fact, whenever Brahmanical authorities encountered new groups – for instance, people living in forests such as the nishadas – or wanted to assign a name to occupational categories such as the goldsmith or suvarnakara, which did not easily fit into the fourfold varna system, they classified them as a jati
Jatis which shared a common occupation or profession were sometimes organised into shrenis or guilds
We seldom come across documents that record the histories of these groups
But there are exceptions
One interesting stone inscription ( c
fifth century CE), found in Mandasor (Madhya Pradesh), records the history of a guild of silk weavers who originally lived in Lata (Gujarat), from where they Fig
3.5 Silver coin depicting a Shaka ruler, c
fourth century CEKINSHIP , CASTE AND CLASS THEMES IN INDIAN HISTORY migrated to Mandasor, then known as Dashapura
It states that they undertook the difficult journey along with their children and kinfolk, as they had heard about the greatness of the local king, and wanted to settle in his kingdom
The inscription provides a fascinating glimpse of complex social processes and provides insights into the nature of guilds or shrenis
Although membership was based on a shared craft specialisation, some members adopted other occupations
It also indicates that the members shared more than a common profession – they collectively decided to invest their wealth, earned through their craft, to construct a splendid temple in honour of the sun god
What the silk weavers did Here is an excerpt from the inscription, which is in Sanskrit: Some are intensely attached to music (so) pleasing to the ear; others, being proud of (the authorship of) a hundred excellent biographies, are conversant with wonderful tales; (others), filled with humility , are absorbed in excellent religious discourses; some excel in their own religious rites; likewise by others, who were self-possessed, the science of (V edic) astr onomy was mastered; and others, valorous in battle, even today forcibly cause harm to the enemies
3.4 Beyond the four varnas : Integration Given the diversity of the subcontinent, there were, and always have been, populations whose social practices were not influenced by Brahmanical ideas
When they figure in Sanskrit texts, they are often described as odd, uncivilised, or even animal-like
In some instances, these included forest-dwellers – for whom hunting and gathering remained an important means of subsistence
Categories such as the nishada, to which Ekalavya is supposed to have belonged, are examples of this
Others who were viewed with suspicion included populations such as nomadic pastoralists, who could not be easily accommodated within the framework of settled agriculturists
Sometimes those who spoke non-Sanskritic languages were labelled asThe case of the merchants Sanskrit texts and inscriptions used the term vanik to designate merchants
While trade was defined as an occupation for Vaishyas in the Shastras, a more complex situation is evident in plays such as the Mrichchhakatika written by Shudraka ( c
fourth century CE), Here, the hero Charudatta was described as both a Brahmana and a sarthavaha or merchant And a fifth-century inscription describes two brothers who made a donation for the construction of a temple as kshatriya-vaniks.Source 8 Ü Do you think the silk weavers were following the occupation laid down for them in the Shastras? mlechchhas and looked down upon
There was nonetheless also a sharing of ideas and beliefs between these people
The nature of relations is evident in some stories in the Mahabharata
A tiger-like husband This is a summary of a story from the Adi Parvan of the Mahabharata: The Pandavas had fled into the forest
They were tired and fell asleep; only Bhima, the second Pandava, renowned for his prowess, was keeping watch
A man-eating rakshasa caught the scent of the Pandavas and sent his sister Hidimba to capture them
She fell in love with Bhima, transformed herself into a lovely maiden and proposed to him
He refused
Meanwhile, the rakshasa arrived and challenged Bhima to a wrestling match
Bhima accepted the challenge and killed him
The others woke up hearing the noise
Hidimba introduced herself, and declared her love for Bhima
She told Kunti: I have forsaken my friends, my dharma and my kin; and good lady , chosen your tiger-like son for my man whether you think me a fool, or your devoted servant, let me join you, great lady, with your son as my husband. Ultimately , Yudhisthira agr eed to the marriage on condition that they would spend the day together but that Bhima would return every night
The couple roamed all over the world during the day
In due course Hidimba gave birth to a rakshasa boy named Ghatotkacha
Then the mother and son left the Pandavas
Ghatotkacha promised to return to the Pandavas whenever they needed him
Some historians suggest that the term rakshasa is used to describe people whose practices differed from those laid down in Brahmanical texts
3.5 Beyond the four varnas Subordination and conflict While the Brahmanas considered some people as being outside the system, they also developed a sharper social divide by classifying certain social categories as “untouchable”
This rested on a notion that certain activities, especially those connected with the performance of rituals, were sacred and bySource 9 Ü Identify the practices described in this passage which seem non-Brahmanical.KINSHIP , CASTE AND CLASS THEMES IN INDIAN HISTORY extension “pure”
Those who considered themselves pure avoided taking food from those they designated as “untouchable”
In sharp contrast to the purity aspect, some activities were regarded as particularly “polluting”
These included handling corpses and dead animals
Those who performed such tasks, designated as chandalas, were placed at the very bottom of the hierarchy
Their touch and, in some cases, even seeing them was regarded as “polluting” by those who claimed to be at the top of the social order
The Manusmriti laid down the “duties” of the chandalas
They had to live outside the village, use discarded utensils, and wear clothes of the dead and ornaments of iron
They could not walk about in villages and cities at night
They had to dispose of the bodies of those who had no relatives and serve as executioners
Much later, the Chinese Buddhist monk Fa Xian ( c
fifth century CE) wrote that “untouchables” had to sound a clapper in the streets so that people could avoid seeing them
Another Chinese pilgrim, Xuan Zang ( c
seventh century), observed that executioners and scavengers were forced to live outside the city
By examining non-Brahmanical texts which depict the lives of chandalas , historians have tried to find out whether chandalas accepted the life of degradation prescribed in the Shastras
Sometimes, these depictions correspond with those in the Brahmanical texts
But occasionally, there are hints of different social realities

Be yond Bir th Resour ces and S tatus If you recall the economic relations discussed in Chapter 2, you will realise that slaves, landless agricultural labourers, hunters, fisherfolk, pastoralists, peasants, village headmen, craftspersons, merchants and kings emerged as social actors in different parts of the subcontinent
Their social positions were often shaped by their access to economic resources
Here we will examine the social implications of access to resources in certain specific situations
4.1 Gendered access to property Consider first a critical episode in the Mahabharata
During the course of the long-drawn rivalry between the Kauravas and the Pandavas, Duryodhana invited Yudhisthira to a game of dice
The latter, who was deceived by his rival, staked his gold, elephants, chariots, slaves, army, treasury, kingdom, the property of his subjects, his brothers and finally himself and lost all
Then he staked their common wife Draupadi and lost her too
Issues of ownership, foregrounded in stories such as this one (Source ), also figure in the Dharmasutras and Dharmashastras
According to the Manusmriti, the paternal estate was to be divided equally amongst sons after the death of the parents, with a special share for the eldest
Women could not claim a share of these resources
However, women were allowed to retain the gifts they received on the occasion of their marriage as stridhana (literally, a woman’s wealth)
This could be inherited by their children, without the husband having any claim on it
At the same time, the Manusmriti warned women against hoarding family property, or even their own valuables, without the husband’s permission
You have read about wealthy women such as the Vakataka queen Prabhavati Gupta (Chapter 2)
However, cumulative evidence – both epigraphic and textual – suggests that while upper-class women may have had access to resources, land, cattle and money were generally controlled by men
In other words, social differences between men and women were sharpened because of the differences in access to resources.Draupadis question Draupadi is supposed to have asked Y udhisthira whether he had lost himself before staking her
Two contrary opinions wer e expressed in response to this question
One, that even if Y udhisthira had lost himself earlier , his wife remained under his control, so he could stak e her
Two, that an unfr ee man (as Yudhisthira was when he had lost himself) could not stake another person
The matter remained unresolved; ultimately , Dhritarashtra r estored to the Pandavas and Draupadi their personal freedom.Source Ü Do you think that this episode suggests that wives could be treated as the property of their husbands? How could men and women acquire wealth? For men, the Manusmriti declares, there are seven means of acquiring wealth: inheritance, finding, purchase, conquest, investment, work, and acceptance of gifts from good people
For women, there are six means of acquiring wealth: what was given in front of the fire (marriage) or the bridal procession, or as a token of affection, and what she got from her br other , mother or father
She could also acquir e wealth through any subsequent gift and whatever her affectionate husband might give her
4.2 Varna and access to property According to the Brahmanical texts, another criterion (apart from gender) for regulating access to wealth was varna
As we saw earlier, the only “occupation” prescribed for Shudras was servitude, while a variety of occupations were listed for men of the first three varnas
If these provisions were actually implemented, the wealthiest men would have been the Brahmanas and the Kshatriyas
That this corresponded to some extent with social realities is evident from descriptions of priests and kings in other textual traditions
Kings are almost invariably depicted as wealthy; priests are also generally shown to be rich, though there are occasional depictions of the poor Brahmana
At another level, even as the Brahmanical view of society was codified in the Dharmasutras and Dharmashastras , other traditions developed critiques of the varna order
Some of the best-known of these were developed within early Buddhism (c
sixth century BCE onwards; see also Chapter 4)
The Buddhists recognised that there were differences in society, but did not regard these as natural or inflexible
They also rejected the idea of claims to status on the basis of birth.Source KINSHIP , CASTE AND CLASS Ü Compare and contrast the ways in which men and women could acquire wealth
THEMES IN INDIAN HISTORY The wealthy Shudra This story , based on a Buddhist te xt in P ali known as the Majjhima Nikaya, is part of a dialogue between a king named A vantiputta and a disciple of the Buddha named Kachchana
While it may not be literally true, it reveals Buddhist attitudes towards varna
Avantiputta ask ed K achchana what he thought about Brahmanas who held that they were the best caste and that all other castes were low; that Brahmanas were a fair caste while all other castes were dark; that only Brahmanas were pure, not non-Brahmanas; that Brahmanas were sons of Brahma, born of his mouth, born of Brahma, formed by Brahma, heirs to Brahma
Kachchana replied: What if a Shudra were wealthy would another Shudra or a Kshatriya or a Brahmana or a V aishya speak politely to him? Avantiputta r eplied that if a Shudra had wealth or corn or gold or silver , he could have as his obedient servant another Shudra to get up earlier than he, to go to r est later , to carry out his or ders, to speak politely; or he could even have a Kshatriya or a Brahmana or a Vaishya as his obedient servant
Kachchana ask ed:  This being so, ar e not these four varnas exactly the same? Avantiputta conceded that ther e was no differ ence amongst the varnas on this count
4.3 An alternative social scenario: Sharing wealth So far we have been examining situations where people either claimed or were assigned status on the basis of their wealth
However, there were other possibilities as well; situations where men who were generous were respected, while those who were miserly or simply accumulated wealth for themselves were despised
One area where these values were cherished was ancient Tamilakam, where, as we saw earlier (Chapter 2), there were several chiefdoms around 2,000 years ago
Amongst other things, the chiefs were patrons of bards and poets who sang their praise
Poems included in the Tamil Sangam anthologies often illuminate social and economicSource Ü Read Avantiputta’s first statement again

The poor generous chief In this composition from the Puranaruru , one of the anthologies of poems of the T amil Sangam literatur e (c
first century CE), a bard describes his patron to other poets thus : He (i.e
the patr on) doesn t have the wealth to lavish on others everyday Nor does he have the pettiness to say that he has nothing and so refuse! he lives in Irantai (a place) and is generous
He is an enemy to the hunger of bards! If you wish to cur e your poverty , come along with me, bards whose lips are so skilled! If we request him, showing him our ribs thin with hunger , he will go to the blacksmith of his village And will say to that man of powerful hands: Shape me a long spear for war , one that has a straight blade!Source Ü What are the strategies which the bard uses to try and persuade the chief to be generous?

Explaining Social Differences: A Social Contract The Buddhists also developed an alternative understanding of social inequalities, and of the institutions required to regulate social conflict
In a myth found in a text known as the Sutta Pitaka they suggested that originally human beings did not have fully evolved bodily forms, nor was the world of plants fully developed
All beings lived in an idyllic state of peace, taking from nature only what they needed for each meal
However, there was a gradual deterioration of this state as human beings became increasingly greedy, vindictive and deceitful
This led them to wonder: “What if we were to select a certain being who should be wrathful when indignation is right, who should censure that which should rightly be censured and should banish him who deserves to be banished? We will give him in return a proportion of the rice ..
chosen by the whole people, he will be known as mahasammata, the great elect.” This suggests that the institution of kingship was based on human choice, with taxes as a form of payment for services rendered by the king
At the same time, it reveals recognition of human agency in creating and institutionalising economic and social relations
There are other implications as well
For instance, if human beings were responsible for the creation of the system, they could also change it in future

Handling Texts Historians and t he Mahabhar ata If you look through the sources cited in this chapter once more you will notice that historians consider several elements when they analyse texts
They examine whether texts were written in Prakrit, Pali or Tamil, languages that were probably used by ordinary people, or in Sanskrit, a language meant almost exclusively for priests and elites
They also consider the kinds of text
Were these mantras, learnt and chanted by ritual specialists, or stories that people could have read, or heard, and then retold if they found them interesting? Besides, they try to find out about the author(s) whose perspectives and ideas shaped the text, as well as the intended audience , as, very often, authors keep the interests of their audience in mind while composing their work
And they try and ascertain the possible date of the composition or compilation of the texts as well as the place where they may have been composed
It is only after making these assessments that they draw on the content of texts to arrive at an understanding of their historical significance
As you can imagine, this is a particularly difficult task for a text as complex as the Mahabharata
6.1 Language and content Let us look at the language of the text
The version of the Mahabharata we have been considering is in Sanskrit (although there are versions in other languages as well)
However, the Sanskrit used in the Mahabharata is far simpler than that of the Vedas, or of the prashastis discussed in Chapter 2
As such, it was probably widely understood
Historians usually classify the contents of the present text under two broad heads – sections that contain stories, designated as the narrative , and sections that contain prescriptions about social norms, designated as didactic
This division is by no means watertight – the didactic sections include stories, and the narrative often contains a social message
However, generally historians agree that the Mahabharata was meant to be a dramatic, moving story, and that the didactic portions were probably added later
Fig
3.8 Krishna advises Arjuna on the battlefield This painting dates to the eighteenth century
Perhaps the most important didactic section of the Mahabharata is the Bhagavad Gita, which contains the advice offered by Lord Krishna to Arjuna
This scene is frequently depicted in painting and sculpture.Didactic refers to something that is meant for purposes of instruction
KINSHIP , CASTE AND CLASS THEMES IN INDIAN HISTORY Interestingly, the text is described as an itihasa within early Sanskrit tradition
The literal meaning of the term is “thus it was”, which is why it is generally translated as “history”
Was there a real war that was remembered in the epic? We are not sure
Some historians think that the memory of an actual conflict amongst kinfolk was preserved in the narrative; others point out that there is no other corroborative evidence of the battle
6.2 Author(s) and dates Who wrote the text? This is a question to which there are several answers
The original story was probably composed by charioteer-bards known as sutas who generally accompanied Kshatriya warriors to the battlefield and composed poems celebrating their victories and other achievements
These compositions circulated orally
Then, from the fifth century BCE, Brahmanas took over the story and began to commit it to writing
This was the time when chiefdoms such as those of the Kurus andFig
3.9 Lord Ganesha the scribe According to tradition, Vyasa dictated the text to the deity
This illustration is from a Persian translation of the Mahabharata , c
1740-
Panchalas, around whom the story of the epic revolves, were gradually becoming kingdoms
Did the new kings want their itihasa to be recorded and preserved more systematically? It is also possible that the upheavals that often accompanied the establishment of these states, where old social values were often replaced by new norms, are reflected in some parts of the story
We notice another phase in the composition of the text between c
200 BCE and 200 CE
This was the period when the worship of Vishnu was growing in importance, and Krishna, one of the important figures of the epic, was coming to be identified with Vishnu
Subsequently, between c
200 and 400 CE, large didactic sections resembling the Manusmriti were added
With these additions, a text which initially perhaps had less than ,000 verses grew to comprise about 100,000 verses
This enormous composition is traditionally attributed to a sage named Vyasa
6.3 The search for convergence The Mahabharata, like any major epic, contains vivid descriptions of battles, forests, palaces and settlements
In 1951-, the archaeologist B.B
Lal excavated at a village named Hastinapura in Meerut (Uttar Pradesh)
Was this the Hastinapura of the epic? While the similarity in names could be coincidental, the location of the site in the Upper Ganga doab, where the Kuru kingdom was situated, suggests that it may have been the capital of the Kurus mentioned in the text
Lal found evidence of five occupational levels, of which the second and third are of interest to us
This is what Lal noted about the houses in the second phase ( c
twelfth-seventh centuries BCE): “Within the limited area excavated, no definite plans of houses were obtained, but walls of mud and mud-bricks were duly encountered
The discovery of mud-plaster with prominent reed-marks suggested that some of the houses had reed walls plastered over with mud.” For the third phase ( c
sixth-third centuries BCE), he noted: “Houses of this period were built of mud-brick as well as burnt bricks
Soakage jars and brick drains were used for draining out refuse water, while terracotta ring-wells may have been used both as wells and drainage pits.”KINSHIP , CASTE AND CLASS THEMES IN INDIAN HISTORY Was the description of the city in the epic added after the main narrative had been composed, when (after the sixth century BCE) urban centres flourished in the region? Or was it a flight of poetic fancy, which cannot always be verified by comparisons with other kinds of evidence? Consider another instance
One of the most challenging episodes in the Mahabharata is Draupadi’s marriage with the Pandavas, an instance of polyandry that is central to the narrative
If we examine the section of the epic that describes this event, it is evident that the author(s) attempted to explain it in a variety of ways
Draupadis marriage Drupada, the king of Panchala, organised a competition where the challenge was to string a bow and hit a target; the winner would be chosen to marry his daughter Draupadi
Arjuna was victorious and was garlanded by Draupadi
The Pandavas returned with her to their mother Kunti, who, even before she saw them, asked them to share whatever they had got
She realised her mistake when she saw Draupadi, but her command could not be violated
A fter much deliberation, Y udhisthira decided that Draupadi would be their common wife
When Drupada was told about this, he protested
However , the seer V yasa arrived and told him that the Pandavas were in reality incarnations of Indra, whose wife had been reborn as Draupadi, and they were thus destined for each other
Vyasa added that in another instance a young woman had prayed to Shiva for a husband, and in her enthusiasm, had prayed five times instead of once
This woman was now reborn as Draupadi, and Shiva had fulfilled her prayers
Convinced by these stories, Drupada consented to the marriage.Fig

A wall excavated at HastinapuraHastinapura This is how the city is described in the Adi Parvan of the Mahabharata: The city , bursting lik e the ocean, packed with hundreds of mansions, displayed with its gateways, arches and turrets like massing clouds the splendour of Great Indras city
Source Source Ü Do you think Lal’s finds match the description of Hastinapura in the epic? Ü Why do you think the author(s) offered three explanations for a single episode? Present-day historians suggest that the fact that the author(s) describe a polyandrous union indicates that polyandry may have been prevalent amongst ruling elites at some point of time
At the same time, the fact that so many different explanations are offered for the episode (Source ) suggests that polyandry gradually fell into disfavour amongst the Brahmanas, who reworked and developed the text through the centuries
Some historians note that while the practice of polyandry may have seemed unusual or even undesirable from the Brahmanical point of view, it was (and is) prevalent in the Himalayan region
Others suggest that there may have been a shortage of women during times of warfare, and this led to polyandry
In other words, it was attributed to a situation of crisis
Some early sources suggest that polyandry was not the only or even the most prevalent form of marriage
Why then did the author(s) choose to associate this practice with the central characters of the Mahabharata ? We need to remember that creative literature often has its own narrative requirements and does not always literally reflect social realities
7
A Dynamic T ext The growth of the Mahabharata did not stop with the Sanskrit version
Over the centuries, versions of the epic were written in a variety of languages through an ongoing process of dialogue between peoples, communities, and those who wrote the texts
Several stories that originated in specific regions or circulated amongst certain people found their way into the epic
At the same time, the central story of the epic was often retold in different ways
And episodes were depicted in sculpture and painting
They also provided themes for a wide range of performing arts – plays, dance and other kinds of narrations.Ü Discuss..
Read the excerpts from the Mahabharata included in this chapter once more
For each of these, discuss whether they could have been literally true
What do these excerpts tell us about those who composed the text? What do they tell us about those who must have read or heard the epic?KINSHIP , CASTE AND CLASS THEMES IN INDIAN HISTORY Most retellings or re-enactments of the epic draw on the main narrative in creative ways
Let us look at one example, an episode from the Mahabharata that has been transformed by Mahashweta Devi, a contemporary Bengali writer known for raising her voice against all forms of exploitation and oppression
In this particular instance, she works out alternative possibilities from the main story of the Mahabharata and draws attention to questions on which the Sanskrit text is silent
The Sanskrit text describes how Duryodhana plotted to kill the Pandavas by inviting them to stay in a specially prepared house of lac, which he planned to set on fire
Forewarned, the Pandavas dug a tunnel to ensure their escape
Then Kunti arranged for a feast
While most of the invitees were Brahmanas, a nishada woman came with her five sons
When they were satiated with drink and fell off to sleep, the Pandavas escaped, setting fire to the house
When the bodies of the woman and her sons were discovered, people thought that the Pandavas were dead
In her short story titled “Kunti O Nishadi”, Mahashweta Devi takes up the narrative from where the Mahabharata ends it
She sets the story in a forest, where Kunti retires after the war
Kunti now has time to reflect on her past, and often confesses to what she regards as her failings, talking with the earth, the symbol of nature
Every day she sees the nishadas who come to collect wood, honey, tubers and roots
One nishadi (a nishada woman) often listens to Kunti when she talks with the earth
One day, there was something in the air; the animals were fleeing the forest
Kunti noticed that the nishadi was watching her, and was startled when she spoke to her and asked if she remembered the house of lac
Yes, Kunti said, she did
Did she remember a certain elderly nishadi and her five young sons? And that she had served them wine till they were senseless, while she escaped with her own sons? That nishadi ..
“Not you!” Kunti exclaimed
The nishadi replied that the woman who was killed had been her mother-in-law
She added that while Kunti had been reflecting on her past, not once did she remember the six innocent lives that were lost because she had wanted to save herself and her sons
As they spoke, the flames drew nearer
The nishadi escaped to safety, but Kunti remained where she was

Made of a stone called steatite, seals like this one often contain animal motifs and signs from a script that remains undeciphered
Y et we know a great deal about the lives of the people who lived in the region from what they left behind – their houses, pots, ornaments, tools and seals – in other words, from archaeological evidence
Let us see what we know about the Harappan civilisation, and how we know about it
W e will explore how archaeological material is interpreted and how interpretations sometimes change
Of course, there are some aspects of the civilisation that are as yet unknown and may even remain so
Terminologies, Places and T ime “The Harappan Civilisation ” is also known as the Indus V alley Civilisation
The term Harappa is derived from the place where the civilization was identified
The total time span of the civilisation ranges from 6000 BCE to 1300 BCE
The early phase, termed as Early Harappan (6000 BCE-2600 BCE) is a formative phase of the civilisation
The urban phase of the civilisation, termed as Mature Harappan (2600 BCE-1900 BCE) is the most prosperous phase
The decline of the civilisation starts around 1900 BCE
Th is decadent phase (1900 BCE-1300 BCE) is termed as Late Harappan
The distinctive Harappan pottery , bricks (bak ed and unbak ed) seals, weights, beads, copper and bronze articles, belonging to the Harappan civilisation have been found in the region, as apart as Afghanistan, Baluchistan, Sind and Punjab provinces of Pakistan and the Indian States of Jammu and K ashmir , Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat and Maharashtra (Map 1).Fig

Beginnings There were several archaeological cultures in the region prior to the Mature Harappan
These cultures were associated with distinctive pottery , evidence of agriculture and pastoralism, and some crafts
Settlements were generally small, and there were virtually no large buildings
The recent archaeological evidences also indicate the emergence of Harappan culture from early farming communities dated around 7000 BC E
The urban phase (Mature Harappan) was a consequent result of the gradual transformation and internal development of the civilisation during the early Harappan phase
2
Subsistence Strategies If you look at Maps 1 and 2 you will notice that the Mature Harappan culture developed in some of the areas occupied by the Early Harappan cultures
These cultures also shared certain common elements including subsistence strategies
The Harappans ate a wide range of plant and animal products, including fish
A rchaeologists have be en able to reconstruct dietary practices from finds of charred grains and seeds
These are studied by archaeo-botanists, who are specialists in ancient plant remains
G rainsHarappan Settlements So far , mor e than 2000 Harappan archaeological sites have been discovered in the Indian sub-continent
Most of the sites are found located between The Indus and The Saraswati river basins
Nearly two-third s of these settlements are in the Saraswati basin, suggesting its immense importance for the Harappan Civilisation
Among these, five major cities have been identified
These are Rakhigarhi, Mohenjodaro, Harappa, Dholavira and Ganweriwala
The remaining sites come under different categories such as Regional Centre s, agricultural villages, ports and manufacturing centres.You will find certain abbreviations, related to dates, in this book

Millets are found from sites in Gujarat
Finds of rice are relatively rare
Animal bones found at Harappan sites include those of cattle, sheep, goat, buffalo and pig
Studies done by archaeo-zoologists or zoo- archaeologists indicate that these animals were domesticated
Bones of wild species such as boar, deer and gharial are also found
We do not know whether the Harappans hunted these animals themselves or obtained meat from other hunting communities
Bones of fish and fowl are also found
2.1 Agricultural technologies While the prevalence of agriculture is indicated by finds of grain, it is more difficult to reconstruct actual agricultural practices
Were seeds broadcast (scattered) on ploughed lands? Representations on seals and terracotta sculpture indicate that the bull was known, and archaeologists extrapolate from this that oxen were used for ploughing
Moreover, terracotta models of the plough have been found at sites in Cholistan and at Banawali (Haryana)
Archaeologists have also found evidence of a ploughed field at Kalibangan (Rajasthan), associated with Early Harappan levels (see p
)
The field had two sets of furrows at right angles to each other, suggesting that two different crops were grown together
Archaeologists have also tried to identify the tools used for harvesting
Did the Harappans use stone blades set in wooden handles or did they use metal tools? Most Harappan sites are located in semi-arid lands, where irrigation was probably required for agriculture
Traces of canals have been found at the Harappan site of Shortughai in Afghanistan, but not in Punjab or Sind

It is also likely that water drawn from wells was used for irrigation
Besides, water reservoirs found in Dholavira (Gujarat) may have been used to store water for agriculture
How artefacts are identified Processing of food required grinding equipment as well as vessels for mixing, blending and cooking
These were made of stone, metal and terracotta
This is an excerpt from one of the earliest reports on excavations at Mohenjodaro, the best-known Harappan site: Saddle querns are found in considerable numbers and they seem to have been the only means in use for grinding cereals
As a rule, they were roughly made of har d, gritty , igneous r ock or sandstone and mostly show signs of hard usage
As their bases are usually convex, they must have been set in the earth or in mud to pr event their r ocking
T wo main types have been found: those on which another smaller stone was pushed or rolled to and fro, and others with which a second stone was used as a pounder , eventually making a large cavity in the nether stone
Querns of the former type were probably used solely for grain; the second type possibly only for pounding herbs and spices for making curries
In fact, stones of this latter type are dubbed curry stones by our workmen and our cook asked for the loan of one from the museum for use in the kitchen

5 Ü How is the Lower Town different from the Citadel?3
Mohanjodaro A Planned Urban Centre Perhaps the most unique feature of the Harappan civilisation was the development of urban centres
Let us lo ok at one such centre, M ohenjodaro, more closely
Although M ohenjodaro is the most well-known site, the first site to be discovered was Harappa
The settlement is divided into two sections, one smaller but higher and the other much larger butFig
1.7 Layout of Mohenjodaro BRICKS, BEADS AND BONES metres THEMES IN INDIAN HISTORY 6 The plight of Harappa Although Harappa was the first site to be discovered, it was badly destroyed by brick robbers
As early as 1875, Alexander Cunningham, the first Director-General of the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), often called the father of Indian ar chaeology , noted that the amount of brick taken from the ancient site was enough to lay bricks for about 100 miles of the railway line between L ahor e and Multan
Thus, many of the ancient structures at the site were damaged
In contrast, Mohenjodaro was far better preserved.lower
Archaeologists designate these as the Citadel and the Lower Town respectively
The Citadel owes its height to the fact that buildings were constructed on mud brick platforms
It was walled, which meant that it was physically separated from the Lower Town
The Lower Town was also walled
Several buildings were built on platforms, which served as foundations
It has been calculated that if one labourer moved roughly a cubic metre of earth daily, just to put the foundations in place it would have required four million person-days, in other words, mobilising labour on a very large scale
Consider something else
Once the platforms were in place, all building activity within the city was restricted to a fixed area on the platforms
So it seems that the settlement was first planned and then implemented accordingly
Other signs of planning include bricks, which, whether sun-dried or baked, were of a standardised ratio, where the length and breadth were four times and twice the height respectively
Such bricks were used at all Harappan settlements
3.1 Laying out drains One of the most distinctive features of Harappan cities was the carefully planned drainage system
If you look at the plan of the Lower Town you will notice that roads and streets were laid out along an approximate “grid” pattern, intersecting at right angles
It seems that streets with drains were laid out first and then houses built along them
If domestic waste water had to flow into the street drains, every house needed to have at least one wall along a street
Citadels While most Harappan settlements have a small high western part and a larger lower eastern section, there are variations
At sites such as Dholavira and Lothal (Gujarat), the entire settlement was fortified, and sections within the town were also separated by walls
The Citadel within Lothal was not walled off, but was built at a height.Fig
1.8 A drain in Mohenjodaro Notice the huge opening of the drain
7 3.2 Domestic architecture The Lower Town at Mohenjodaro provides examples of residential buildings
Many were centred on a courtyard, with rooms on all sides
The courtyard was probably the centre of activities such as cooking and weaving, particularly during hot and dry weather
What is also interesting is an apparent concern for privacy: there are no windows in the walls along the ground level
Besides, the main entrance does not give a direct view of the interior or the courtyard
Every house had its own bathroom paved with bricks, with drains connected through the wall to the street drains
Some houses have remains of staircases to reach a second storey or the roof
Many houses had wells, often in a room that could be reached from the outside and perhaps used by passers-by
Scholars have estimated that the total number of wells in Mohenjodaro was about 700.The most ancient system yet discovered About the drains, Mackay noted: It is certainly the most complete ancient system as yet discovered. Every house was connected to the street drains
The main channels were made of bricks set in mortar and were covered with loose bricks that could be removed for cleaning
In some cases, limestone was used for the covers
House drains first emptied into a sump or cesspit into which solid matter settled while waste water flowed out into the street drains
Very long drainage channels were provided at intervals with sumps for cleaning
It is a wonder of archaeology that little heaps of material, mostly sand, have frequently been found lying alongside drainage channels, which shows that the debris was not always carted away when the drain was cleared
FROM ERNEST MACKA Y, Early Indus Civilisation , 1948
Drainage systems were not unique to the larger cities, but were found in smaller settlements as well
At Lothal for example, while houses were built of mud bricks, drains were made of burnt bricks

What is the entrance to the house like?BRICKS, BEADS AND BONES Source 2 THEMES IN INDIAN HISTORY 8 3.3 The Citadel It is on the Citadel that we find evidence of structures that were probably used for special public purposes
These include the warehouse – a massive structure of which the lower brick portions remain, while the upper portions, probably of wood, decayed long ago – and the Great Bath
The Great Bath was a large rectangular tank in a courtyard surrounded by a corridor on all four sides
There were two flights of steps on the north and south leading into the tank, which was made watertight by setting bricks on edge and using a mortar of gypsum
There were rooms on three sides, in one of which was a large well
Water from the tank flowed into a huge drain
Across a lane to the north lay a smaller building with eight bathrooms, four on each side of a corridor, with drains from each bathroom connecting to a drain that ran along the corridor
The uniqueness of the structure, as well as the context in which it was found (the Citadel, with several distinctive buildings), has led scholars to suggest that it was meant for some kind of a special ritual bath

Tracking Social Differences 4.1 Burials Archaeologists generally use certain strategies to find out whether there were social or economic differences amongst people living within a particular culture
These include studying burials
You are probably familiar with the massive pyramids of Egypt, some of which were contemporaneous with the Harappan civilisation
Many of these pyramids were royal burials, where enormous quantities of wealth was buried
At burials in Harappan sites the dead were generally laid in pits
Sometimes, there were differences in the way the burial pit was made – in some instances, the hollowed-out spaces were lined with bricks
Could these variations be an indication of social differences? We are not sure
Some graves contain pottery and ornaments, perhaps indicating a belief that these could be used in the afterlife
Jewellery has been found in burials of both men and women
In fact, in the excavations at the cemetery in Harappa in the mid-1980s, an ornament consisting of three shell rings, a jasper (a kind of semi-precious stone) bead and hundreds of micro beads was found near the skull of a male
In some instances the dead were buried with copper mirrors
But on the whole, it appears that the Harappans did not believe in burying precious things with the dead
4.2 Looking for “luxuries” Another strategy to identify social differences is to study artefacts, which archaeologists broadly classify as utilitarian and luxuries
The first category includes objects of daily use made fairly easily out of ordinary materials such as stone or clay
These include querns, pottery, needles, flesh-rubbers (body scrubbers), etc., and are usually found distributed throughout settlements
Archaeologists assume objects were luxuries if they are rare or made from costly, non-local materials or with complicated technologies
Thus, little pots of faience (a material made of ground sand or silica mixed with colour and a gum and then fired) were probably considered precious because they were difficult to make
The situation becomes more complicated when we find what seem to be articles of daily Fig
1
A copper mirror BRICKS, BEADS AND BONES Fig
1
A faience pot THEMES IN INDIAN HISTORY use, such as spindle whorls made of rare materials such as faience
Do we classify these as utilitarian or luxuries? If we study the distribution of such artefacts, we find that rare objects made of valuable materials are generally concentrated in large settlements like Mohenjodaro and Harappa and are rarely found in the smaller settlements
For example, miniature pots of faience, perhaps used as perfume bottles, are found mostly in Mohenjodaro and Harappa, and there are none from small settlements like Kalibangan
Gold too was rare, and as at present, probably precious – all the gold jewellery found at Harappan sites was recovered from hoards
5
Finding Out About Craft Production Locate Chanhudaro on Map 1
This is a tiny settlement (less than 7 hectares) as compared to Mohenjodaro (125 hectares), almost exclusively devoted to craft production, including bead-making, shell-cutting, metal-working, seal-making and weight-making
The variety of materials used to make beads is remarkable: stones like carnelian (of a beautiful red colour), jasper, crystal, quartz and steatite; metals like copper, bronze and gold; and shell, faience and terracotta or burnt clay
Some beads were made of two or more stones, cemented together, some of stone with gold caps
The shapes were numerous – disc- shaped, cylindrical, spherical, barrel-shaped, segmented
Some were decorated by incising or painting, and some had designs etched onto them.Ü Discuss..
What are the modes of disposal of the dead prevalent at present? To what extent do these represent social differences?Hoards are objects kept carefully by people, often inside containers such as pots
Such hoards can be of jewellery or metal objects saved for reuse by metalworkers
If for some reason the original owners do not retrieve them, they remain where they are left till some archaeologist finds them
Fig
1
A tool and b eads Techniques for making beads differed according to the material
Steatite, a very soft stone, was easily worked
Some beads were moulded out of a paste made with steatite powder
This permitted making a variety of shapes, unlike the geometrical forms made out of harder stones
How the steatite micro bead was made remains a puzzle for archaeologists studying ancient technology
Archaeologists’ experiments have revealed that the red colour of carnelian was obtained by firing the yellowish raw material and beads at various stages of production
Nodules were chipped into rough shapes, and then finely flaked into the final form
Grinding, polishing and drilling completed the process
Specialised drills have been found at Chanhudaro, Lothal and more recently at Dholavira
If you locate Nageshwar and Balakot on Map 1, you will notice that both settlements are near the coast
These were specialised centres for making shell objects – including bangles, ladles and inlay – which were taken to other settlements
Similarly, it is likely that finished products (such as beads) from Chanhudaro and Lothal were taken to the large urban centres such as Mohenjodaro and Harappa
5.1 Identifying centres of production In order to identify centres of craft production, archaeologists usually look for the following: raw material such as stone nodules, whole shells, copper ore; tools; unfinished objects; rejects and waste material
In fact, waste is one of the best indicators of craft work
For instance, if shell or stone is cut to make objects, then pieces of these materials will be discarded as waste at the place of production.Fig
1
Pottery Some of these can be seen in the National Museum, Delhi or in the site museum at Lothal
Ü Discuss..
Should the stone artefacts illustrated in the chapter be considered as utilitarian objects or as luxuries? Are there any that may fall into both categories?BRICKS, BEADS AND BONES Fig
1
A terracotta figurine THEMES IN INDIAN HISTORY Sometimes, larger waste pieces were used up to make smaller objects, but minuscule bits were usually left in the work area
These traces suggest that apart from small, specialised centres, craft production was also undertaken in large cities such as Mohenjodaro and Harappa
6
Strategies for Procuring Materials As is obvious, a variety of materials was used for craft production
While some such as clay were locally available, many such as stone, timber and metal had to be procured from outside the alluvial plain
Terracotta toy models of bullock carts suggest that this was one important means of transporting goods and people across land routes
Riverine routes along the Indus and its tributaries, as well as coastal routes were also probably used
6.1 Materials from the subcontinent and beyond The Harappans procured materials for craft production in various ways
For instance, they established settlements such as Nageshwar and Balakot in areas where shell was available
Other such sites were Shortughai, in far-off Afghanistan, near the best source of lapis lazuli, a blue stone that was apparently very highly valued, and Lothal which was near sources of carnelian (from Bharuch in Gujarat), steatite (from south Rajasthan and north Gujarat) and metal (from Rajasthan)
Another strategy for procuring raw materials may have been to send expeditions to areas such as the Khetri region of Rajasthan (for copper) and south India (for gold)
These expeditions established communication with local communities
Occasional finds of Harappan artefacts such as steatite micro beads in these areas are indications of such contact
There is evidence in the Khetri area for what archaeologists call the Ganeshwar-Jodhpura culture, with its distinctive non-Harappan pottery and an unusual wealth of copper objects
It is possible that the inhabitants of this region supplied copper to the Harappans.Fig.1
Copper and bronze vessels 6.2 Contact with distant lands Recent archaeological finds suggest that copper was also probably brought from Oman, on the south- eastern tip of the Arabian peninsula
Chemical analyses have shown that both the Omani copper and Harappan artefacts have traces of nickel, suggesting a common origin
There are other traces of contact as well
A distinctive type of vessel, a large Harappan jar coated with a thick layer of black clay has been found at Omani sites
Such thick coatings prevent the percolation of liquids
We do not know what was carried in these vessels, but it is possible that the Harappans exchanged the contents of these vessels for Omani copper
Mesopotamian texts datable to the third millennium BCE refer to copper coming from a region called Magan, perhaps a name for Oman, and interestingly enough copper found atFig

Other archaeological finds suggestive of long- distance contacts include Harappan seals, weights, dice and beads
In this context, it is worth noting that Mesopotamian texts mention contact with regions named Dilmun (probably the island of Bahrain), Magan and Meluhha, possibly the Harappan region
They mention the products from Meluhha: carnelian, lapis lazuli, copper, gold, and varieties of wood
A Mesopotamian myth says of Meluhha: “May your bird be the haja-bird, may its call be heard in the royal palace.” Some archaeologists think the haja-bird was the peacock
Did it get this name from its call? It is likely that communication with Oman, Bahrain or Mesopotamia was by sea
Mesopotamian texts refer to Meluhha as a land of seafarers
Besides, we find depictions of ships and boats on seals
Fig

This is a cylinder seal, typical of Mesopotamia, but the humped bull motif on it appears to be derived from the Indus region

The round “Persian Gulf” seal found in Bahrain sometimes carries Harappan motifs
Interestingly, local “Dilmun” weights followed the Harappan standard

Seal depicting a boat Ü Discuss..
What were the possible routes from the Harappan region to Oman, Dilmun and Mesopotamia? 7
Seals, Scr ipt, W eights 7.1 Seals and sealings Seals and sealings were used to facilitate long- distance communication
Imagine a bag of goods being sent from one place to another
Its mouth was tied with rope and on the knot was affixed some wet clay on which one or more seals were pressed, leaving an impression
If the bag reached with its sealing intact, it meant that it had not been tampered with
The sealing also conveyed the identity of the sender
7.2 An enigmatic script Harappan seals usually have a line of writing, probably containing the name and title of the owner
Scholars have also suggested that the motif (generally an animal) conveyed a meaning to those who could not read
Most inscriptions are short, the longest containing about signs
Although the script remains undeciphered to date, it was evidently not alphabetical (where each sign stands for a vowel or a consonant) as it has just too many signs – somewhere between 375 and 400
It is apparent that the script was written from right to left as some seals show a wider spacing on the right and cramping on the left, as if the engraver began working from the right and then ran out of space
Consider the variety of objects on which writing has been found: seals, copper tools, rims of jars, copper and terracotta tablets, jewellery, bone rods, even an ancient signboard! Remember , there may have been writing on perishable materials too
Could this mean that literacy was widespread? 7.3 Weights Exchanges were regulated by a precise system of weights, usually made of a stone called chert and generally cubical (Fig
1.2), with no markings

What are their advantages and problems?BRICKS, BEADS AND BONES THEMES IN INDIAN HISTORY lower denominations of weights were binary (1, 2, 4, 8, , ), while the higher denominations followed the decimal system (160, 200, 320, 640)
The smaller weights were probably used for weighing jewellery and beads
Metal scale-pans have also been found
8
Ancient A uthor ity There are indications of complex decisions being taken and implemented in Harappan society
Take for instance, the extraordinary uniformity of Harappan artefacts as evident in pottery (Fig
1.), seals, weights and bricks
Notably, bricks, though obviously not produced in any single centre, were of a uniform ratio throughout the region, from Jammu to Gujarat
W e have also seen that settlements wer e strategically set up in specific locations for various reasons
Besides, labour was mobilised for making bricks and for the construction of massive walls and platforms
Who organised these activities? 8.1 Palaces and kings If we look for a centre of power or for depictions of people in power , archaeological r ecords pr ovide no immediate answers
A large building found at Mohenjodaro was labelled as a palace by archaeologists but no spectacular finds were associated with it
A stone statue was labelled and continues to be known as the “priest-king”
This is because archaeologists were familiar with Mesopotamian history and its “priest-kings” and have found parallels in the Indus region
But as we will see (p.), the ritual practices of the Harappan civilisation are not well understood yet nor are there any means of knowing whether those who performed them also held political power
Some archaeologists are of the opinion that Harappan society had no rulers, and that everybody enjoyed equal status
Others feel there was no single ruler but several, that Mohenjodaro had a separate ruler , Harappa another , and so forth
Y et others argue that there was a single state, given the similarity in artefacts, the evidence for planned settlements, the standardised ratio of brick size, and the establishment of settlements near sources of rawÜ Discuss..
Could everybody in Harappan society have been equal?Fig

I t is likely that the Harappans practiced some sort of democratic system
Some of the structures with their given features were created apparently for utilitarian purposes
9
The End of the Civilisation There is evidence tha t by c
1800 BCE most of the Mature Harappan sites in regions such as Cholistan had be en abandoned
Simultaneously , there was an expansion of population into new settlements in G ujarat, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh
In the few Harappan sites that continued to be occupied after 1900 BCE there appears to have be en a transformation of material culture, marked by the disappearance of the distinctive artefacts of the civilisation – weights, seals, special beads
W riting, long-distance trade, and craft specialisation also disappeared
In general, far fewer materials were used to make far fewer things
H ouse construction techniques deteriorated and large public structures were no longer produced
O verall, artefacts and settlements indicate a rural way of life in what are called “L ate Harappan” or “successor cultures”
What brought about these changes? Several explanations have been put forward
These range from climatic change, deforestation, excessive floods, the shifting and/or drying up of rivers, to overuse of the landscape
Some of these “causes” may hold for certain settlements, but they do not explain the collapse of the entire civilisation
It appears that a strong unifying element, perhaps the Harappan state, came to an end
This is evidenced by the disappearance of seals, the script, distinctive beads and pottery , the shift from a standardised weight system to the use of local weights; and the decline and abandonment of cities
The subcontinent would have to wait for over a millenniu m for new cities to develop in a completely differen t region.BRICKS, BEADS AND BONES SWAT LATE SISWALCEMETERY H RANGPUR II B-CJHUKARIndus Arabian SeaMap 4 Areas of Late Harappan occupation Sketch map not to scale Ü Discuss..

Much later , in 1947, R .E.M
Wheeler , then Dir ector -General of the ASI, tried to corr elate this ar chaeological evidence with that of the Rigveda, the earliest known text in the subcontinent
He wrote: The Rigveda mentions pur, meaning rampart, fort or str onghold
Indra, the Aryan war -god is called puramdara , the fort-destr oyer
Where are – or were – these citadels? It has in the past been supposed that they were mythical ..
The recent excavation of Harappa may be thought to have changed the picture
Here we have a highly evolved civilisation of essentially non-Aryan type, now known to have employed massive fortifications ..
What destroyed this firmly settled civilisation? Climatic, economic or political deterioration may have weakened it, but its ultimate extinction is more likely to have been completed by deliberate and large-scale destruction
It may be no mere chance that at a late period of Mohenjodaro men, women, and children, appear to have been massacred there
On circumstantial evidence, Indra stands accused

As you can see, a careful re-examination of the data can sometimes lead to a reversal of earlier interpretations
In this respect, it is necessary to mention the recent archaeogenetic research carried out at the site of Rakhigarhi
The site, located in Hisar district of Haryana, is the biggest Harappan city , spread over an ar ea of 550 Hectare
In order to study the genetic history of the Harappans, DNA was extracted from the skeletal remains excavated at Rakhigarhi
This research was carried out by The Deccan College Deemed University , Pune in collaboration with Centr e for Cellular and Molecular Biology , Hyderabad and The Harvar d Medical College
The analysis of the data indicates that the Harappans are the indigenous people of this region
The genetic roots of the Harappans go back to ,000 BCE
The DNA of the Harappans has continued till today and a majority of the South Asian population appears to be their descendents
Due to trade and cultural contacts of the Harappans with distant regions there is a mixture of genes in small quantity
The continuity without any br eak in genetic history as well as cultural history rules out large scale immigration of the so-called Aryans
This research also indicates that the people coming from border ing areas and distant regions were absorbed in the Indian society
At no stage, the genetic history of the Indians was either discontinued or broken
As the Harappans started moving towards Iran and Central Asia, their genes also gradually spread in these regions
The same team of researchers reconstructed 3D features of the Harappan people
The reconstructed facial features of the Harappans, male and female, show remarkable similarity with the modern population of Haryana
Thus, this study has indicated unbroken continuity for 5000 years in this region

Disco vering t he Har appan Civilisation So far , we have examined facets of the Harappan civilisation in the context of how archaeologists have used evidence from material remains to piece together parts of a fascinating history
However , there is another story as well – about how archaeologists “discovered” the civilisation
When Harappan cities fell into ruin, people gradually forgot all about them
When men and women began living in the area millennia later , they did not know what to make of the strange artefacts that occasionally surfaced, washed by floods or exposed by soil erosion, or turned up while ploughing a field, or digging for treasure
.1 Cunningham’s confusion When C unningham, the first Director -General of the ASI, began archaeological excavations in the mid- ninete enth century , archaeologists preferred to use the written word (texts and inscriptions) as a guide to investigations
I n fact, C unningham’ s main interest was in the archaeology of the Early H istoric (c
sixth century BCE-fourth century CE) and later periods
H e used the accounts left by C hinese Buddhist pilgrims who had visited the subcontinent betwe en the fourth and seventh centuries CE to locate early settlements
Cunningham also collected, documented and translated inscriptions found during his surveys
When he excavated sites he tended to recover artefacts that he thought had cultural value
A site like Harappa, which was not part of the itinerary of the C hinese pilgrims and was not known as an Early H istoric city , did not fit very neatly within his framework of investigation
So, although Harappan artefacts were found fairly often during the nineteenth century and some of these reached Cunningham, he did not realise how old these were
A Harappan seal was given to Cunningham by an Englishman
H e noted the object, but unsuccessfully tried to place it within the time-frame with which he was familiar
This was because he, like many others, thought that Indian history began with the first cities in the G anga valley (se e Chapter 2)
G iven his specific focus, it is not surprising that he missed the significance of Harappa.Fig

THEMES IN INDIAN HISTORY Sites, mounds, layers Archaeological sites are formed through the production, use and discarding of materials and structures
When people continue to live in the same place, their constant use and reuse of the landscape results in the build up of occupational debris, called a mound
Brief or permanent abandonment results in alteration of the landscape by wind or water activity and erosion
Occupations are detected by traces of ancient materials found in layers , which differ from one another in colour , texture and the artefacts that are found in them
Abandonment or desertions, what are called sterile layers, can be identified by the absence of such traces
Generally , the lowest layers are the oldest and the highest are the most recent
The study of these layers is called stratigraphy
Artefacts found in layers can be assigned to specific cultural periods and can thus provide the cultural sequence for a site..2 A new old civilisation Subsequently, seals were discovered at Harappa by archaeologists such as Daya Ram Sahni in the early decades of the twentieth century, in layers that were definitely much older than Early Historic levels
It was then that their significance began to be realised
Another archaeologist, Rakhal Das Banerji found similar seals at Mohenjodaro, leading to the conjecture that these sites were part of a single archaeological culture
Based on these finds, in 1924, John Marshall, Director-General of the ASI, announced the discovery of a new civilisation in the Indus valley to the world
As S.N
Roy noted in The Story of Indian Archaeology, “Marshall left India three thousand years older than he had found her.” This was because similar, till-then-unidentified seals were found at excavations at Mesopotamian sites
It was then that the world knew not only of a new civilisation, but also of one contemporaneous with Mesopotamia
In fact, John Marshall’s stint as Director-General of the ASI marked a major change in Indian archaeology
He was the first professional archaeologist to work in India, and brought his experience of working in Greece and Crete to the field
More importantly, though like Cunningham he too was interested in spectacular finds, he was equally keen to look for patterns of everyday life
Marshall tended to excavate along regular horizontal units, measured uniformly throughout the mound, ignoring the stratigraphy of the site
This meant that all the artefacts recovered from the same unit were grouped together, even if they were found at different stratigraphic layers
As a result, valuable Fig
1
The stratigraphy of a small mound Notice that the layers are not exactly horizontal
information about the context of these finds was irretrievably lost
.3 New techniques and questions It was R.E .M
Whe eler, after he to ok over as Director - General of the ASI in 1944, who rectified this problem
Wheeler recognised that it was necessary to follow the stratigraphy of the mound rather than dig mechanically along uniform horizontal lines
M oreover , as an ex-army brigadier , he brought with him a military precision to the practice of archaeology
The frontiers of the Harappan civilisation have little or no connection with present-day national boundaries
H owever , with the partition of the subcontinent and the creation of Pakistan, the major known sites became part of Pakistan
This has spurred Indian archaeologists to try and locate sites in India
A n extensive survey in Kutch has revealed a number of Harappan settlements and explorations in Punjab and Haryana have added to the list of Harappan sites
While K alibangan, L othal, Rakhi Garhi and most recently D holavira have be en discovered, explored and excavated as part of these efforts, fresh explorations continue
Over the decades, new issues have assumed importance
Where some archaeologists are often keen to obtain a cultural sequence, others try to understand the logic underlying the location of specific sites
They also grapple with the wealth of artefacts, trying to figure out the functions these may have served
Since the 1980s, there has also been growing international interest in Harappan archaeology
Specialists from the subcontinent and abroad have been jointly working at both Harappa and Mohenjodaro
They are using modern scientific techniques including surface exploration to recover traces of clay , stone, metal and plant and animal remains as well as to minutely analyse every scrap of available evidence
These explorations promise to yield interesting results in the future.Wheeler at Harappa Early archaeologists were often driven by a sense of adventure
This is what Wheeler wrote about his experience at Harappa: It was, I recall, on a warm May night in 1944 that a four miles’ tonga -ride brought me as the newly appointed Director General of the Archaeological Survey with my local Muslim officer from a little railway-station labelled “Harappa” along a deep sand track to a small rest- house beside the moonlit mounds of the ancient site
Warned by my anxious colleague that we must start our inspection at 5
next morning and finish by 7
“after which it would be too hot”, we turned in with the dark figure of the punka -walla crouched patiently in the entrance and the night air rent by innumerable jackals in the neighbouring wilderness
Next morning, punctually at 5., our little procession started out towards the sandy heaps
Within ten minutes I stopped and rubbed my eyes as I gazed upon the tallest mound, scarcely trusting my vision
Six hours later my embarrassed staff and I were still toiling with picks and knives under the blazing sun, the mad sahib (I am afraid) setting a relentless pace

Which of the themes in this chapter would have interested Cunningham? Which are the issues that have been of interest since 1947?BRICKS, BEADS AND BONES THEMES IN INDIAN HISTORY 1 1
Pr oblems of Piecing T ogether the P ast As we have seen, it is not the Harappan script that helps in understanding the ancient civilisation
Rather, it is material evidence that allows archaeologists to better reconstruct Harappan life
This material could be pottery, tools, ornaments, household objects, etc
Organic materials such as cloth, leather, wood and reeds generally decompose, especially in tropical regions
What survive are stone, burnt clay (or terracotta), metal, etc
It is also important to remember that only broken or useless objects would have been thrown away
Other things would probably have been recycled
Consequently, valuable artefacts that are found intact were either lost in the past or hoarded and never retrieved
In other words, such finds are accidental rather than typical
.1 Classifying finds Recovering artefacts is just the beginning of the archaeological enterprise
Archaeologists then classify their finds
One simple principle of classification is in terms of material, such as stone, clay, metal, bone, ivory, etc
The second, and more complicated, is in terms of function: archaeologists have to decide whether, for instance, an artefact is a tool or an ornament, or both, or something meant for ritual use
An understanding of the function of an artefact is often shaped by its resemblance with present-day things – beads, querns, stone blades and pots are obvious examples
Archaeologists also try to identify the function of an artefact by investigating the context in which it was found: was it found in a house, in a drain, in a grave, in a kiln? Sometimes, archaeologists have to take recourse to indirect evidence
For instance, though there are traces of cotton at some Harappan sites, to find out about clothing we have to depend on indirect evidence including depictions in sculpture
Archaeologists have to develop frames of reference
We have seen that the first Harappan seal that was found could not be understood till archaeologists had a context in which to place it – both in terms of the cultural sequence in which it was found, and in terms of a comparison with finds in Mesopotamia
.2 Problems of interpretation The problems of archaeological interpretation are perhaps most evident in attempts to reconstruct religious practices
Early archaeologists thought that certain objects which seemed unusual or unfamiliar may have had a religious significance
These included terracotta figurines of women, heavily jewelled, some with elaborate head-dresses
These were regarded as mother goddesses
Rare stone statuary of men in an almost standardised posture, seated with one hand on the knee – such as the “priest-king” – was also similarly classified
In other instances, structures have been assigned ritual significance
These include the Great Bath and fire altars found at Kalibangan and Lothal
Attempts have also been made to reconstruct religious beliefs and practices by examining seals, some of which seem to depict ritual scenes
Others, with plant motifs, are thought to indicate nature worship
Some animals – such as the one-horned animal, often called the “unicorn” – depicted on seals seem to be mythical, composite creatures
In some seals, a figure shown seated cross-legged in a “yogic” posture, sometimes surrounded by animals, has been regarded as a depiction of “proto-Shiva”, that is, an early form of one of the major deities of Hinduism
Besides, conical stone objects have been classified as lingas
Many reconstructions of Harappan religion are made on the assumption that later traditions provide parallels with earlier ones
This is because archaeologists often move from the known to the unknown, that is, from the present to the past
While this is plausible in the case of stone querns and pots, it becomes more speculative when we extend it to “religious” symbols
Let us look, for instance, at the “proto-Shiva” seals
The earliest religious text, the Rigveda (compiled c
1500-1000 BCE) mentions a god named Rudra, which is a name used for Shiva in later Puranic traditions (in the first millennium CE; see also Chapter 4)
However, unlike Shiva, Rudra in the Rigveda is neither depicted as Pashupati (lord of animals in general and cattle in particular), nor as a yogi
In other words, this depiction does not match the description of Rudra in the Rigveda
Is this, then, possibly a shaman as some scholars have suggested?Fig

We have be en able to tease out social differences and we have some idea of how the civilisation functioned
It is really not clear how much more we would know if the script were to be deciphered
If a bilingual inscription is found, questions about the languages spoken by the Harappans could perhaps be put to rest
Several reconstructions remain speculative at present
W as the G reat Bath a ritual structure? H ow widespread was literacy? Why do Harappan cemeteries show little social differentiation? Also unanswered are questions on gender – did women make pottery or did they only paint pots (as at present)? What about other craftspersons? What were the terracotta female figurines used for? V ery few scholars have investigated issues of gender in the context of the Harappan civilisation and this is a whole new area for future work
More research is also required on the relationship betwe en the Harappans and the V edic people as some scholars have argued that the authors of the Harappans civilisation and the V edic people were the same.Shamans are men and women who claim magical and healing powers, as well as an ability to communicate with the other world
This is what Mackay , one of the earliest excavators, had to say about these stones: Various small cones made of lapis lazuli, jasper , chalcedony , and other stones, most beautifully cut and finished, and less than two inches in height, are also thought to be lingas ..
on the other hand, it is just as possible that they were used in the board-games ..

This was also the period during which the Rigveda was composed by people living along the Indus and its tributaries
Agricultural settlements emerged in many parts of the subcontinent, including north India, the Deccan Plateau, and parts of Karnataka
Besides, there is evidence of pastoral populations in the Deccan and further south
New modes of disposal of the dead, including the making of elaborate stone structures known as megaliths, emerged in central and south India from the first millennium BCE
In many cases, the dead were buried with a rich range of iron tools and weapons
From c
sixth century BCE, there is evidence that there were other trends as well
Perhaps the most visible was the emergence of early states, empires and kingdoms
Underlying these political processes were other changes, evident in the ways in which agricultural production was organised
Simultaneously, new towns appeared almost throughout the subcontinent
Historians attempt to understand these developments by drawing on a range of sources – inscriptions, texts, coins and visual material
As we will see, this is a complex process

Pr insep and Piy adassi Some of the most momentous developments in Indian epigraphy took place in the 1830s
This was when James Prinsep, an officer in the mint of the East India Company, deciphered Brahmi and Kharosthi, two scripts used in the earliest inscriptions and coins
He found that most of these mentioned a king referred to as Piyadassi – meaning “pleasant to behold”; there were a few inscriptions which alsoTHEME TWO Fig
2.1 An inscription, Sanchi (Madhya Pradesh), c
second century BCE referred to the king as Asoka, one of the most famous rulers known from Buddhist texts
This gave a new direction to investigations into early Indian political history as European and Indian scholars used inscriptions and texts composed in a variety of languages to reconstruct the lineages of major dynasties that had ruled the subcontinent
As a result, the broad contours of political history were in place by the early decades of the twentieth century
Subsequently, scholars began to shift their focus to the context of political history, investigating whether there were connections between political changes and economic and social developments
It was soon realised that while there were links, these were not always simple or direct
2
The Ear lies t States 2.1 The sixteen mahajanapadas The sixth century BCE is often regarded as a major turning point in early Indian history
It is an era associated with early states, cities, the growing use of iron, the development of coinage, etc
It also witnessed the growth of diverse systems of thought, including Buddhism and Jainism
Early Buddhist and Jaina texts (see also Chapter 4) mention, amongst other things, sixteen states known as mahajanapadas
Although the lists vary, some names such as Vajji, Magadha, Koshala, Kuru, Panchala, Gandhara and Avanti occur frequently
Clearly, these were amongst the most important mahajanapadas
While most mahajanapadas were ruled by kings, some, known as ganas or sanghas , were oligarchies (p
), where power was shared by a number of men, often collectively called rajas
Both Mahavira and the Buddha (Chapter 4) belonged to such ganas
In some instances, as in the case of the Vajji sangha , the rajas probably controlled resources such as land collectively
Although their histories are often difficult to reconstruct due to the lack of sources, some of these states lasted for nearly a thousand years
Each mahajanapada had a capital city, which was often fortified
Maintaining these fortified cities as well as providing for incipient armies and bureaucracies required resources
From c
sixthInscriptions Inscriptions are writings engraved on hard surfaces such as stone, metal or pottery
They usually r ecor d the achievements, activities or ideas of those who commissioned them and include the exploits of kings, or donations made by women and men to religious institutions
Inscriptions are virtually permanent records, some of which carry dates
Others are dated on the basis of palaeography or styles of writing, with a fair amount of precision
For instance, in c
250 BCE the letter a was written like this:
By c
500 CE, it was written like this:
The earliest inscriptions were in Prakrit, a name for languages used by ordinary people
Names of rulers such as Ajatasattu and Asoka, known from Prakrit texts and inscriptions, have been spelt in their Prakrit forms in this chapter
You will also find terms in languages such as Pali, Tamil and Sanskrit, which too were used to write inscriptions and texts
It is possible that people spoke in other languages as well, even though these were not used for writing
Janapada means the land where a jana (a people, clan or tribe) sets its foot or settles
It is a word used in both Prakrit and Sanskrit.KINGS, FARMERS AND TOWNS THEMES IN INDIAN HISTORY Map 1 Early states and their capitals Arabian Sea Bay of BengalKAMBOJA GANDHARAPushkalavati Taxila SHURASENA Mathura MATSYAIndraprastha Ahichchhatra KURU PANCHALA Kaushambi CHEDI AVANTI Ujjayini ASHMAKAVATSAShravasti VANGAChampaANGA RajgirMAGADHAVaishaliVAJJI (VRIJJI)KusinagaraMALLA VaranasiKASHIKOSHALA Sketch map not to scale century BCE onwards, Brahmanas began composing Sanskrit texts known as the Dharmasutras
These laid down norms for rulers (as well as for other social categories), who were ideally expected to be Kshatriyas (see also Chapter 3)
Rulers were advised to collect taxes and tribute from cultivators, traders and artisans
Were resources also procured from pastoralists and forest peoples? We do not really know
What we do know is that raids on neighbouring states were recognised as a legitimate means of acquiring wealth
Gradually, some states acquired standing armies and maintained regular bureaucracies
Others continued to depend on militia, recruited, more often than not, from the peasantry.Oligarchy refers to a form of government where power is exercised by a group of men
The Roman Republic, about which you read last year, was an oligarchy in spite of its name.Ü Which were the areas where states and cities were most densely clustered? 2.2 First amongst the sixteen: Magadha Between the sixth and the fourth centuries BCE, Magadha (in present-day Bihar) became the most powerful mahajanapada
Modern historians explain this development in a variety of ways: Magadha was a region where agriculture was especially productive
Besides, iron mines (in present-day Jharkhand) were accessible and provided resources for tools and weapons
Elephants, an important component of the army, were found in forests in the region
Also, the Ganga and its tributaries provided a means of cheap and convenient communication
However, early Buddhist and Jaina writers who wrote about Magadha attributed its power to the policies of individuals: ruthlessly ambitious kings of whom Bimbisara, Ajatasattu and Mahapadma Nanda are the best known, and their ministers, who helped implement their policies
Initially, Rajagaha (the Prakrit name for present- day Rajgir in Bihar) was the capital of Magadha
Interestingly, the old name means “house of the king”
Rajagaha was a fortified settlement, located amongst hills
Later, in the fourth century BCE, the capital was shifted to Pataliputra, present-day Patna, commanding routes of communication along the Ganga .Ü Discuss..

2.2 Fortification walls at Rajgir Ü Why were these walls built? THEMES IN INDIAN HISTORY 3
An Ear ly Em pire The growth of Magadha culminated in the emergence of the Mauryan Empire
Chandragupta Maurya, who founded the empire ( c
321 BCE), extended control as far northwest as Afghanistan and Baluchistan, and his grandson Asoka, arguably the most famous ruler of early India, conquered Kalinga (present-day coastal Orissa)
3.1 Finding out about the Mauryas Historians have used a variety of sources to reconstruct the history of the Mauryan Empire
These include archaeological finds, especially sculpture
Also valuable are contemporary works, such as the account of Megasthenes (a Greek ambassador to the court of Chandragupta Maurya), which survives in fragments
Another source that is often used is the Arthashastra, parts of which were probably composed by Kautilya or Chanakya, traditionally believed to be the minister of Chandragupta
Besides, the Mauryas are mentioned in later Buddhist, Jaina and Puranic literature, as well as in Sanskrit literary works
While these are useful, the inscriptions of Asoka ( c
272/268-231 BCE) on rocks and pillars are often regarded as amongst the most valuable sources
Asoka was the first ruler who inscribed his messages to his subjects and officials on stone surfaces – natural rocks as well as polished pillars
He used the inscriptions to proclaim what he understood to be dhamma
This included respect towards elders, generosity towards Brahmanas and those who renounced worldly life, treating slaves and servants kindly, and respect for religions and traditions other than one’s own
3.2 Administering the empire There were five major political centres in the empire – the capital Pataliputra and the provincial centres of Taxila, Ujjayini, Tosali and Suvarnagiri, all mentioned in Asokan inscriptions
If we examine the content of these inscriptions, we find virtually the same message engraved everywhere – from the present-day North West Frontier Provinces of Pakistan, to Andhra Pradesh, Orissa and Uttara khand in India
Could this vast empire have had a uniform administrative system? Historians have increasingly come to realise thatLanguages and scripts Most Asokan inscriptions were in the Prakrit language while those in the northwest of the subcontinet were in Aramaic and Greek
Most Prakrit inscriptions were written in the Brahmi script; however , some, in the northwest, were written in Kharosthi
The Aramaic and Greek scripts were used for inscriptions in Afghanistan

2.3 The lion capital Ü Why is the lion capital considered important today? this is unlikely

THEMES IN INDIAN HISTORY Communication along both land and riverine routes was vital for the existence of the empire
Journeys from the centre to the provinces could have taken weeks if not months
This meant arranging for provisions as well as protection for those who were on the move
It is obvious that the army was an important means for ensuring the latter
Megasthenes mentions a committee with six subcommittees for coordinating military activity
Of these, one looked after the navy, the second managed transport and provisions, the third was responsible for foot-soldiers, the fourth for horses, the fifth for chariots and the sixth for elephants
The activities of the second subcommittee were rather varied: arranging for bullock carts to carry equipment, procuring food for soldiers and fodder for animals, and recruiting servants and artisans to look after the soldiers
Asoka also tried to hold his empire together by propagating dhamma, the principles of which, as we have seen, were simple and virtually universally applicable
This, according to him, would ensure the well-being of people in this world and the next
Special officers, known as the dhamma mahamatta, were appointed to spread the message of dhamma
3.3 How important was the empire? When historians began reconstructing early Indian history in the nineteenth century, the emergence of the Mauryan Empire was regarded as a major landmark
India was then under colonial rule, and was part of the British empire
Nineteenth and early twentieth century Indian historians found the possibility that there was an empire in early India both challenging and exciting
Also, some of the archaeological finds associated with the Mauryas, including stone sculpture, were considered to be examples of the spectacular art typical of empires
Many of these historians found the message on Asokan inscriptions very different from that of most other rulers, suggesting that Asoka was more powerful and industrious, as also more humble than later rulers who adopted grandiose titles
So it is not surprising that nationalist leaders in the twentieth century regarded him as an inspiring figure.What the kings officials did Here is an excerpt from the account of Megasthenes: Of the great officers of state, some superintend the rivers, measure the land, as is done in Egypt, and inspect the sluices by which water is let out from the main canals into their branches, so that every one may have an equal supply of it
The same persons have charge also of the huntsmen, and are entrusted with the power of rewarding or punishing them according to their deserts
They collect the taxes, and superintend the occupations connected with land; as those of the woodcutters, the carpenters, the blacksmiths, and the miners
Ü Why were officials appointed to supervise these occupational groups? Ü Discuss..

To what extent do you think these texts are useful in reconstructing a history of Mauryan administration?Source 1 Yet, how important was the Mauryan Empire? It lasted for about 150 years, which is not a very long time in the vast span of the history of the subcontinent
Besides, if you look at Map 2, you will notice that the empire did not encompass the entire subcontinent
And even within the frontiers of the empire, control was not uniform
By the second century BCE, new chiefdoms and kingdoms emerged in several parts of the subcontinent
4
New Notions of Kingship 4.1 Chiefs and kings in the south The new kingdoms that emerged in the Deccan and further south, including the chiefdoms of the Cholas, Cheras and Pandyas in Tamilakam (the name of the ancient Tamil country, which included parts of present-day Andhra Pradesh and Kerala, in addition to Tamil Nadu), proved to be stable and prosperous
Chiefs and chiefdoms A chief is a powerful man whose position may or may not be her editary
He derives support fr om his kinfolk
His functions may include performing special rituals, leadership in warfare, and arbitrating disputes
He receives gifts from his subordinates (unlike kings who usually collect taxes) and often distributes these amongst his supporters
Generally , ther e are no r egular armies and officials in chiefdoms
We know about these states from a variety of sources
For instance, the early Tamil Sangam texts (see also Chapter 3) contain poems describing chiefs and the ways in which they acquired and distributed resources
Many chiefs and kings, including the Satavahanas who ruled over parts of western and central India ( c
second century BCE-second century CE) and the Shakas, a people of Central Asian origin who established kingdoms in the north-western and western parts of the subcontinent, derived revenues from long-distance trade
Their social origins were often obscure, but, as we will see in the case of the Satavahanas (Chapter 3), once they acquired power they attempted to claim social status in a variety of ways.Capturing elephants for the arm y The Arthashastra lays down minute details of administrative and military organisation
This is what it says about how to capture elephants: Guards of elephant forests, assisted by those who rear elephants, those who enchain the legs of elephants, those who guard the boundaries, those who live in forests, as well as by those who nurse elephants, shall, with the help of five or seven female elephants to help in tethering wild ones, trace the whereabouts of herds of elephants by following the course of urine and dung left by elephants
According to Greek sources, the Mauryan ruler had a standing army of 600,000 foot-soldiers, ,000 cavalry and 9,000 elephants
Some historians consider these accounts to be exaggerated.Source 2 Ü If the Greek accounts were true, what kinds of resources do you think the Mauryan ruler would have required to maintain such a large army?KINGS, FARMERS AND TOWNS THEMES IN INDIAN HISTORY 4.2 Divine kings One means of claiming high status was to identify with a variety of deities
This strategy is best exemplified by the Kushanas ( c
first century BCE- first century CE), who ruled over a vast kingdom extending from Central Asia to northwest India
Their history has been reconstructed from inscriptions and textual traditions
The notions of kingship they wished to project are perhaps best evidenced in their coins and sculpture
Colossal statues of Kushana rulers have been found installed in a shrine at Mat near Mathura (Uttar Pradesh)
Similar statues have been found in a shrine in Afghanistan as well
Some historians feel this indicates that the Kushanas considered themselves godlike
Many Kushana rulers also adopted the title devaputra , or “son of god”, possibly inspired by Chinese rulers who called themselves sons of heaven
By the fourth century there is evidence of larger states, including the Gupta Empire
Many of these depended on samantas , men who maintained themselves through local resources including control over land
They offered homage and provided military support to rulers
Powerful samantas could become kings: conversely, weak rulers might find themselves being reduced to positions of subordination
Histories of the Gupta rulers have been reconstructed from literature, coins and inscriptions, including prashastis , composed in praise of kings in particular, and patrons in general, by poets
While historians often attempt to draw factual information from such compositions, those who composed and read them often treasured them as works of poetryThe P andya chief Senguttuvan visits the forest This is an excerpt from the Silappadikaram, an epic written in Tamil: (When he visited the forest) people came down the mountain, singing and dancing just as the defeated show respect to the victorious king, so did they bring gifts  ivory , fragrant wood, fans made of the hair of deer , honey , sandalwood, red ochre, antimony , turmeric, car damom, pepper , etc

A Changing Countryside 5.1 Popular perceptions of kings What did subjects think about their rulers? Obviously, inscriptions do not provide all the answers
In fact, ordinary people rarely left accounts of their thoughts and experiences
Nevertheless, historians have tried to solve this problem by examining stories contained in anthologies such as the Jatakas and the Panchatantra
Many of these stories probably originated as popular oral tales that were later committed to writing
The Jatakas were written in Pali around the middle of the first millennium CE
One story known as the Gandatindu Jataka describes the plight of the subjects of a wicked king; these included elderly women and men, cultivators, herders, village boys and even animals
When the king went in disguise to find out what his subjects thought about him, each one of them cursed him for their miseries, complaining that they were attacked by robbers at night and by tax collectors during the day
To escape from this situation, people abandoned their village and went to live in the forest
As this story indicates, the relationship between a king and his subjects, especially the rural population, could often be strained – kings frequently tried to fill their coffers by demanding high taxes, and peasants particularly found such demands oppressive
Escaping into the forest remained an option, as reflected in the Jataka story
Meanwhile , other strategies aimed at increasing production to meet growing demand for taxes also came to be adopted
5.2 Strategies for increasing production One such strategy was the shift to plough agriculture, which spread in fertile alluvial river valleys such as those of the Ganga and the Kaveri from c
sixth century BCE
The iron-tipped ploughshare was used to turn the alluvial soil in areas which had high rainfall
Moreover, in some parts of the Ganga valley, production of paddy was dramatically increased by the introduction of transplantation, although this meant back-breaking work for the producer
While the iron ploughshare led to a growth in agricultural productivity, its use was restricted to certain parts of the subcontinent – cultivators inTransplantation is used for paddy cultivation in areas where water is plentiful
Here, seeds are first broadcast; when the saplings have grown they are transplanted in waterlogged fields
This ensures a higher ratio of survival of saplings and higher yields.The Sudarshana (beautiful) lake in Gujarat Find Girnar on Map 2
The Sudarshana lake was an artificial reservoir
We know about it from a rock inscription (c
second century CE) in Sanskrit, composed to record the achievements of the Shaka ruler Rudradaman
The inscription mentions that the lake, with embankments and water channels, was built by a local governor during the rule of the Mauryas
However , a terrible storm broke the embankments and water gushed out of the lake
Rudradaman, who was then ruling in the area, claimed to have got the lake repaired using his own resources, without imposing any tax on his subjects
Another inscription on the same rock ( c
fifth century) mentions how one of the rulers of the Gupta dynasty got the lake repaired once again.Source 5 Ü Why did rulers make arrangements for irrigation? areas which were semi-arid, such as parts of Punjab and Rajasthan did not adopt it till the twentieth century, and those living in hilly tracts in the north- eastern and central parts of the subcontinent practised hoe agriculture, which was much better suited to the terrain
Another strategy adopted to increase agricultural production was the use of irrigation, through wells and tanks, and less commonly, canals
Communities as well as individuals organised the construction of irrigation works
The latter, usually powerful men including kings, often recorded such activities in inscriptions
5.3 Differences in rural society While these technologies often led to an increase in production, the benefits were very uneven
What is evident is that there was a growing differentiation amongst people engaged in agriculture – stories, especially within the Buddhist tradition, refer to landless agricultural labourers, small peasants, as well as large landholders
The term gahapati was often used in Pali texts to designate the second and third categories
The large landholders, as well as the village headman (whose position was often hereditary), emerged as powerful figures, and often exercised control over other cultivators
Early Tamil literature (the Sangam texts) also mentions different categories of people living in the villages – large landowners or vellalar , ploughmen or uzhavar and slaves or adimai
It is likely that these differences were based on differential access to land, labour and some of the new technologies
In such a situation, questions of control over land must have become crucial, as these were often discussed in legal texts
Gahapati A gahapati was the owner , master or head of a household, who exercised control over the women, children, slaves and workers who shared a common residence
He was also the owner of the resources  land, animals and other things  that belonged to the household
Sometimes the term was used as a marker of status for men belonging to the urban elite, including wealthy merchants.The importance of boundaries The Manusmrti is one of the best-known legal texts of early India, written in Sanskrit and compiled between c

second century CE
This is what the text advises the king to do: Seeing that in the world controversies constantly arise due to the ignorance of boundaries, he should have concealed boundary markers buried  stones, bones, cow s hair , chaff, ashes, potsherds, dried cow dung, bricks, coal, pebbles and sand
He should also have other similar substances that would not decay in the soil buried as hidden markers at the intersection of boundaries
Ü Would these boundary markers have been adequate to resolve disputes?Source 6KINGS, FARMERS AND TOWNS THEMES IN INDIAN HISTORY 5.4 Land grants and new rural elites From the early centuries of the Common Era, we find grants of land being made, many of which were recorded in inscriptions
Some of these inscriptions were on stone, but most were on copper plates (Fig
2.) which were probably given as a record of the transaction to those who received the land
The records that have survived are generally about grants to religious institutions or to Brahmanas
Most inscriptions were in Sanskrit
In some cases, and especially from the seventh century onwards, part of the inscription was in Sanskrit, while the rest was in a local language such as Tamil or Telugu
Let us look at one such inscription more closely
Prabhavati Gupta was the daughter of one of the most important rulers in early Indian history, Chandragupta II ( c
375-415 CE)
She was married into another important ruling family, that of the Vakatakas, who were powerful in the Deccan (see Map 3)
According to Sanskrit legal texts, women were not supposed to have independent access to resources such as land
However, the inscription indicates that Prabhavati had access to land, which she then granted
This may have been because she was a queen (one of the few known from early Indian history), and her situation was therefore exceptional
It is also possible that the provisions of legal texts were not uniformly implemented
The inscription also gives us an idea about rural populations – these included Brahmanas and peasants, as well as others who were expected to provide a range of produce to the king or his representatives
And according to the inscription, they would have to obey the new lord of the village, and perhaps pay him all these dues
Land grants such as this one have been found in several parts of the country
There were regional variations in the sizes of land donated – ranging from small plots to vast stretches of uncultivated land – and the rights given to donees (the recipients of the grant)
The impact of land grants is a subject of heated debate among historians
Some feel that land grants were part of a strategy adopted by ruling lineages to extend agriculture to new areas
Others suggest that land grants were indicative of weakening political power: as kings were losing control over their samantas , they tried to win alliesÜ How would you classify the people described in the text in terms of their occupations?Life in a small village The Harshacharita is a biography of Harshavardhana, the ruler of Kanauj (see Map 3), composed in Sanskrit by his court poet, Banabhatta ( c
seventh century CE)
This is an excerpt from the text, an extremely rare representation of life in a settlement on the outskirts of a forest in the Vindhyas: The outskirts being for the most part forest, many parcels of rice-land, threshing ground and arable land were being apportioned by small farmers it was mainly spade culture owing to the difficulty of ploughing the sparsely scattered fields covered with grass, with their few clear spaces, their black soil stiff as black iron There were people moving along with bundles of bark countless sacks of plucked flowers, loads of flax and hemp bundles, quantities of honey , peacocks tail feathers, wreaths of wax, logs, and grass
Village wives hastened en route for neighbouring villages, all intent on thoughts of sale and bearing on their heads baskets filled with various gathered forest fruits.Source 7 An agrahara was land granted to a Brahmana, who was usually exempted from paying land revenue and other dues to the king, and was often given the right to collect these dues from the local people

If not, are there any alternative systems in use?Source 8by making grants of land
They also feel that kings tried to project themselves as supermen (as we saw in the previous section) because they were losing control: they wanted to present at least a façade of power
Prabhavati Gupta and the village of Danguna This is what Prabhavati Gupta states in her inscription: Prabhavati Gupta commands the gramakutumbinas (householders/peasants living in the village), Brahmanas and others living in the village of Danguna Be it known to you that on the twelfth (lunar day) of the bright (fortnight) of Karttika, we have, in order to increase our religious merit donated this village with the pouring out of water , to the A charya (teacher) Chanalasvamin Y ou should obey all (his) commands We confer on (him) the following e xemptions typical of an agrahara (this village is) not to be entered by soldiers and policemen; (it is) exempt from (the obligation to provide) grass, (animal) hides as seats, and charcoal (to touring royal officers); exempt from (the royal prerogative of) purchasing fermenting liquors and digging (salt); exempt from (the right to) mines and khadira trees; exempt from (the obligation to supply) flowers and milk; (it is donated) together with (the right to) hidden treasures and deposits (and) together with major and minor taxes  This charter has been written in the thirteenth (regnal) year
(It has been) engraved by Chakradasa
Ü What were the things produced in the village? Land grants provide some insight into the relationship between cultivators and the state
However, there were people who were often beyond the reach of officials or samantas: pastoralists, fisherfolk and hunter-gatherers, mobile or semi- sedentary artisans and shifting cultivators
Generally, such groups did not keep detailed records of their lives and transactions.KINGS, FARMERS AND TOWNS THEMES IN INDIAN HISTORY 6
Towns and T rade 6.1 New cities Let us retrace our steps back to the urban centres that emerged in several parts of the subcontinent from c
sixth century BCE
As we have seen, many of these were capitals of mahajanapadas
Virtually all major towns were located along routes of communication
Some such as Pataliputra were on riverine routes
Others, such as Ujjayini, were along land routes, and yet others, such as Puhar, were near the coast, from where sea routes began
Many cities like Mathura were bustling centres of commercial, cultural and political activity
6.2 Urban populations: Elites and craftspersons We have seen that kings and ruling elites lived in fortified cities
Although it is difficult to conduct extensive excavations at most sites because people live in these areas even today (unlike the Harappan cities), a wide range of artefacts have been recovered from them
These include fine pottery bowls and dishes, with a glossy finish, known as Northern Black Polished Ware, probably used by rich people, and ornaments, tools, weapons, vessels, figurines, made of a wide range of materials – gold, silver, copper, bronze, ivory, glass, shell and terracotta.The history of Pataliputra Each city had a history of its own
Pataliputra, for instance, began as a village known as Pataligrama
Then, in the fifth century BCE, the Magadhan rulers decided to shift their capital from Rajagaha to this settlement and renamed it
By the fourth century BCE, it was the capital of the Mauryan Empire and one of the largest cities in Asia
Subsequently , its importance apparently declined
When the Chinese pilgrim Xuan Zang visited the city in the seventh century CE, he found it in ruins, and with a very small population

These mention the name of the donor, and sometimes specify his/ her occupation as well
They tell us about people who lived in towns: washing folk, weavers, scribes, carpenters, potters, goldsmiths, blacksmiths, officials, religious teachers, merchants and kings
Sometimes, guilds or shrenis , organisations of craft producers and merchants, are mentioned as well
These guilds probably procured raw materials, regulated production, and marketed the finished product
It is likely that craftspersons used a range of iron tools to meet the growing demands of urban elites.KINGS, FARMERS AND TOWNS Votive inscriptions record gifts made to religious institutions.Ü Were there any cities in the region where the Harappan civilisation flourished in the third millennium BCE? THEMES IN INDIAN HISTORY 6.3 Trade in the subcontinent and beyond From the sixth century BCE, land and river routes criss-crossed the subcontinent and extended in various directions – overland into Central Asia and beyond, and overseas, from ports that dotted the coastline – extending across the Arabian Sea to East and North Africa and West Asia, and through the Bay of Bengal to Southeast Asia and China
Rulers often attempted to control these routes, possibly by offering protection for a price
Those who traversed these routes included peddlers who probably travelled on foot and merchants who travelled with caravans of bullock carts and pack-animals
Also, there were seafarers, whose ventures were risky but highly profitable
Successful merchants, designated as masattuvan in Tamil and setthis and satthavahas in Prakrit, could become enormously rich
A wide range of goods were carried from one place to another – salt, grain, cloth, metal ores and finished products, stone, timber, medicinal plants, to name a few
Spices, especially pepper, were in high demand in the Roman Empire, as were textiles and medicinal plants, and these were all transported across the Arabian Sea to the Mediterranean
6.4 Coins and kings To some extent, exchanges were facilitated by the introduction of coinage
Punch-marked coins made of silver and copper ( c
sixth century BCE onwards) were amongst the earliest to be minted and used
These have been recovered from excavations at a number of sites throughout the subcontinent
Numismatists have studied these and other coins to reconstruct possible commercial networks
Attempts made to identify the symbols on punch- marked coins with specific ruling dynasties, including the Mauryas, suggest that these were issued by kings
It is also likely that merchants, bankers and townspeople issued some of these coins
The first coins to bear the names and images of rulers were issued by the Indo-Greeks, who established control over the north-western part of the subcontinent c
second century BCE
The kushanas, however, issued the largest hoards of gold coins first gold coins c
first century CE
These were virtually identical in weight with those issued“Periplus” is a Greek word meaning sailing around and “Erythraean” was the Greek name for the Red Sea.The Malabar coast (present-day K erala) Here is an excerpt from Periplus of the Erythraean Sea , composed by an anonymous Greek sailor ( c
first century CE): They (i.e
traders from abroad) send large ships to these market-towns on account of the great quantity and bulk of pepper and malabathrum (possibly cinnamon, produced in these regions)
There are imported here, in the first place, a great quantity of coin; topaz antimony (a mineral used as a colouring substance), coral, crude glass, copper , tin, lead Ther e is e xported pepper , which is produced in quantity in only one region near these markets Besides this there are exported great quantities of fine pearls, ivory , silk cloth, transparent stones of all kinds, diamonds and sapphires, and tortoise shell
Archaeological evidence of a bead-making industry , using precious and semi-precious stones, has been found in Kodumanal (T amil Nadu)
It is likely that local traders brought the stones mentioned in the Periplus from sites such as these to the coastal ports
Ü Why did the author compile this list?Source 9 by contemporary Roman emperors and the Parthian rulers of Iran, and have been found from several sites in north India and Central Asia
The widespread use of gold coins indicates the enormous value of the transactions that were taking place
Besides, hoards of Roman coins have been found from archaeological sites in south India
It is obvious that networks of trade were not confined within political boundaries: south India was not part of the Roman Empire, but there were close connections through trade
Coins were also issued by tribal republics such as that of the Yaudheyas of Punjab and Haryana (c
first century CE)
Archaeologists have unearthed several thousand copper coins issued by the Yaudheyas, pointing to the latter’s interest and participation in economic exchanges
Some of the most spectacular gold coins were issued by the Gupta rulers
The earliest issues are remarkable for their purity
These coins facilitated long-distance transactions from which kings also benefited
From c
sixth century CE onwards, finds of gold coins taper off
Does this indicate that there was some kind of an economic crisis? Historians are divided on this issue
Some suggest that with the collapse of the Western Roman Empire long-distance trade declined, and this affected the prosperity of the states, communities and regions that had benefited from it
Others argue that new towns and networks of trade started emerging around this time
They also point out that though finds of coins of that time are fewer, coins continue to be mentioned in inscriptions and texts
Could it be that there are fewer finds because coins were in circulation rather than being hoarded?Numismatics is the study of coins, including visual elements such as scripts and images, metallurgical analysis and the contexts in which they have been found

Bac k to Basics How Are Inscriptions Deciphered? So far, we have been studying excerpts from inscriptions amongst other things
But how do historians find out what is written on them? 7.1 Deciphering Brahmi Most scripts used to write modern Indian languages are derived from Brahmi, the script used in most Asokan inscriptions
From the late eighteenth century, European scholars aided by Indian pandits worked backwards from contemporary Bengali and Devanagari (the script used to write Hindi) manuscripts, comparing their letters with older specimens
Scholars who studied early inscriptions sometimes assumed these were in Sanskrit, although the earliest inscriptions were, in fact, in Prakrit
It was only after decades of painstaking investigations by several epigraphists that James Prinsep was able to decipher Asokan Brahmi in 1838
7.2 How Kharosthi was read The story of the decipherment of Kharosthi, the script used in inscriptions in the northwest, is different
Here, finds of coins of Indo-Greek kings who ruled over the area ( c
second-first centuries BCE) haveFig

An Asokan inscription Fig

Asokan Brahmi with Devanagari equivalents Ü Do some Devanagari letters appear similar to Brahmi? Are there any that seem different? facilitated matters
These coins contain the names of kings written in Greek and Kharosthi scripts
European scholars who could read the former compared the letters
For instance, the symbol for “a” could be found in both scripts for writing names such as Apollodotus
With Prinsep identifying the language of the Kharosthi inscriptions as Prakrit, it became possible to read longer inscriptions as well
7.3 Historical evidence from inscriptions To find out how epigraphists and historians work, let us look at two Asokan inscriptions more closely
Note that the name of the ruler, Asoka, is not mentioned in the inscription (Source )
What is used instead are titles adopted by the ruler – devanampiya , often translated as “beloved of the gods” and piyadassi , or “pleasant to behold”
The name Asoka is mentioned in some other inscriptions, which also contain these titles
After examining all these inscriptions, and finding that they match in terms of content, style, language and palaeography, epigraphists have concluded that they were issued by the same ruler
You may also have noticed that Asoka claims that earlier rulers had no arrangements to receive reports
If you consider the political history of the subcontinent prior to Asoka, do you think this statement is true? Historians have to constantly assess statements made in inscriptions to judge whether they are true, plausible or exaggerations
Did you notice that there are words within brackets? Epigraphists sometimes add these to make the meaning of sentences clear
This has to be done carefully, to ensure that the intended meaning of the author is not changed
Fig
2
A coin of the Indo-Greek king MenanderThe orders of the king Thus speaks king Devanampiya Piyadassi: In the past, there were no arrangements for disposing affairs, nor for receiving regular reports
But I have made the following (arrangement)
Pativedakas should report to me about the affairs of the people at all times, anywhere, whether I am eating, in the inner apartment, in the bedroom, in the cow pen, being carried (possibly in a palanquin), or in the garden
And I will dispose of the affairs of the people everywhere.Source Ü Epigraphists have translated the term pativedaka as reporter
In what ways would the functions of the pativedaka have been different from those we generally associate with reporters today?KINGS, FARMERS AND TOWNS THEMES IN INDIAN HISTORY Historians have to make other assessments as well
If a king’s orders were inscribed on natural rocks near cities or important routes of communication, would passers-by have stopped to read these? Most people were probably not literate
Did everybody throughout the subcontinent understand the Prakrit used in Pataliputra? Would the orders of the king have been followed? Answers to such questions are not always easy to find
Some of these problems are evident if we look at an Asokan inscription (Source ), which has often been interpreted as reflecting the anguish of the ruler, as well as marking a change in his attitude towards warfare
As we shall see, the situation becomes more complex once we move beyond reading the inscription at face value
While Asokan inscriptions have been found in present-day Orissa, the one depicting his anguish is missing
In other words, the inscription has not been found in the region that was conquered
What are we to make of that? Is it that the anguish of the recent conquest was too painful in the region, and therefore the ruler was unable to address the issue? 8
The Limit ations of Inscr iptional Evidence By now it is probably evident that there are limits to what epigraphy can reveal
Sometimes, there are technical limitations: letters are very faintly engraved, and thus reconstructions are uncertain
Also, inscriptions may be damaged or letters missing
Besides, it is not always easy to be sure about the exact meaning of the words used in inscriptions, some of which may be specific to a particular place or time
If you go through an epigraphical journal (some are listed in Timeline 2), you will realise that scholars are constantly debating and discussing alternative ways of reading inscriptions
Although several thousand inscriptions have been discovered, not all have been deciphered, published and translated
Besides, many more inscriptions must have existed, which have not survived the ravages of time
So what is available at present is probably only a fraction of what was inscribed
There is another, perhaps more fundamental, problem: not everything that we may considerThe anguish of the king When the king Devanampiya Piyadassi had been ruling for eight years, the (country of the) Kalingas (present- day coastal Orissa) was conquered by (him)
One hundred and fifty thousand men were deported, a hundred thousand were killed, and many more died
After that, now that (the country of) the Kalingas has been taken, Devanampiya (is devoted) to an intense study of Dhamma, to the love of Dhamma, and to instructing (the people) in Dhamma
This is the repentance of Devanampiya on account of his conquest of the (country of the) Kalingas
For this is considered very painful and deplorable by Devanampiya that, while one is conquering an unconquered (country) slaughter , death and deportation of people (take place) there Ü Discuss..
Look at Map 2 and discuss the location of Asokan inscriptions
Do you notice any patterns?Source politically or economically significant was necessarily recorded in inscriptions
For instance, routine agricultural practices and the joys and sorrows of daily existence find no mention in inscriptions, which focus, more often than not, on grand, unique events
Besides, the content of inscriptions almost invariably projects the perspective of the person(s) who commissioned them
As such, they need to be juxtaposed with other perspectives so as to arrive at a better understanding of the past
Thus epigraphy alone does not provide a full understanding of political and economic history
Also, historians often question both old and new evidence
Scholars in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries were primarily interested in the histories of kings
From the mid-twentieth century onwards, issues such as economic change, and the ways in which different social groups emerged have assumed far more importance
Recent decades have seen a much greater preoccupation with histories of marginalised groups
This will probably lead to fresh investigations of old sources, and the development of new strategies of analysis
