vProofs are to Mathematics what calligraphy is to poetry
Mathematical works do consist of proofs just as poems do consist of characters

A.1.1 Introduction
In Cl asses IX, X and XI, we have learnt about the concepts of a statement, compound statement, negation, converse and contrapositive of a statement; axioms, conjectures, theorems and deductive reasoning
Here, we will discuss various methods of proving mathematical propositions
A.1.2 What
is a Proof? Proof of a mathematical statement consists of sequence of statements, each statement being justified with a definition or an axiom or a proposition that is previously established by the method of deduction using only the allowed logical rules
Thus, each proof is a chain of deductive arguments each of which has its premises and conclusions
Many a times, we prove a proposition directly from what is given in the proposition
But some times it is easier to prove an equivalent proposition rather than proving the proposition itself
This leads to, two ways of proving a proposition directly or indirectly and the proofs obtained are called direct proof and indirect proof and further each has three dif ferent ways of proving which is discussed below
Direct Proof It is the proof of a proposition in which we directly start the proof with what is given in the proposition
(i)Straight for ward appr oach It is a chain of ar guments which leads directly from what is given or assumed, with the help of axioms, definitions or already proved theorems, to what is to be proved using rules of logic
Consider the following example:
Example 1
Show that if x2 – 5x + 6 = 0, then x = 3 or x = 2
Solution
x2 – 5x + 6 = 0 (give n)Appendix 1 PROOFS IN MA THEMA TICS MA THEMA TICS 188 ⇒(x – 3) ( x – 2) = 0 (replacing an expression by an equal/equivalent expression) ⇒x – 3 = 0 or x – 2 = 0 (from the established theorem ab = 0 ⇒ either a = 0 or b = 0, for a, b in R) ⇒x – 3 + 3 = 0 + 3 or x – 2 + 2 = 0 + 2 (adding equal quantities on either side of the equation does not alter the nature of the equation) ⇒x + 0 = 3 or x + 0 = 2 (using the identity property of integers under addition) ⇒x = 3 or x = 2 (using the identity property of integers under addition) Hence, x2 – 5x + 6 = 0 implies x = 3 or x = 2
Expla nation Let p be the given statement “ x2 – 5x + 6 = 0” and q be the conclusion statement “ x = 3 or x = 2”
From the statement p, we deduced the statement r:“(x – 3) ( x – 2) = 0” by replacing the expression x2 – 5x + 6 in the statement p by another expression ( x – 3) (x – 2) which is equal to x2 – 5x + 6
There arise two questions: (i)How does the expression ( x – 3) ( x – 2) is equal to the expression x2 – 5x + 6? (ii) How can we replace an expression with another expression which is equal to the former? The first one is proved in earlier classes by factorization, i.e., x2 – 5x + 6 = x2 – 3x – 2x + 6 = x (x – 3) –2 ( x – 3) = ( x – 3) ( x – 2)
The second one is by valid form of argumentation (rules of logic) Next this statement r becomes premises or given and deduce the statement s “ x – 3 = 0 or x – 2 = 0” and the reasons are given in the brackets
This process continues till we reach the conclusion
The symbolic equivalent of the argument is to prove by deduction that p ⇒ q is true
Starting with p, we deduce p ⇒ r ⇒ s ⇒ ..
⇒ q
This implies that “ p ⇒ q” is true
Example 2
Prove that the function f : R → →→ →→ R defined by f(x) =2x + 5 is one-one
Solution
Note that a function f is one-one if f(x1) =f(x2) ⇒ x1 = x2 (definition of one-one function) Now , given that f(x1) =f(x2), i.e., 2 x1+ 5 = 2 x2 + 5 ⇒ 2x1+ 5 – 5 = 2x2 + 5 – 5 (adding the same quantity on both sides) PROOFS IN MA THEMA TICS 189 ⇒ 2x1+ 0 = 2x2 + 0 ⇒ 2x1 =2x2 (using additive identity of real number) ⇒ 2x = 2x (dividing by the same non zero quantity) ⇒ x1 =x2 Hence, the given function is one-one
(ii) Mat hematical Induction Mathematical induction, is a strategy , of proving a proposition which is deductive in nature
The whole basis of proof of this method depends on the following axiom: For a given subset S of N, if (i)the natural number 1 ∈ S and (ii) the natural number k + 1 ∈ S whenever k ∈ S, then S = N
According to the principle of mathematical induction, if a statement “S( n) is true for n = 1” (or for some starting point j), and if “S(n) is true for n = k” implies that “S(n) is true for n = k + 1” (whatever integer k ≥ j may be), then the statement is true for any positive integer n, for all n ≥ j
We now cons ider some examples
Example 3
Show that if A = cos sin sin cosθ θ    - θ θ , then An =cos sin sin cosn n n nθ θ    - θ θ
Solution
We have P(n) : An =cos sin sin cosn n n nθ θ    - θ θ  We note that P(1) : A1 =cos sin sin cosθ θ    - θ θ  Therefore, P(1) is true
Assume that P( k) is true, i.e., P(k): Ak =cos sin sin cosk k k kθ θ    - θ θ  MA THEMA TICS 190 We want to prove that P(k + 1) is true whenever P( k) is true, i.e., P(k + 1) : Ak+1 =cos ( 1) sin ( 1) sin( 1) cos ( 1 )k k k k+ θ + θ    - + θ + θ  Now Ak+1 = Ak
A Since P( k) is true, we have Ak+1 =cos sin sin cosk k k kθ θ    - θ θ  cos sin sin cosθ θ    - θ θ  = cos cos sin sin cos sin sin cos sin cos cos sin sin sin cos cosk k k k k k k kθ θ - θ θ θ θ + θ θ    - θ θ - θ θ - θ θ + θ θ  (by matrix multiplication) = cos ( 1) sin ( 1) sin( 1) cos ( 1 )k k k k+ θ + θ    - + θ + θ  Thus, P( k + 1) is true whenever P( k) is true
Hence, P( n) is true for all n ≥ 1 (by the principle of mathematical induction)
(iii) Proof by cases or by exhaustion This method of proving a statement p ⇒ q is possible only when p can be split into several cases, r, s, t (say) so that p = r ∨ s ∨ t (where “ ∨” is the symbol for “OR”)
If the conditionals r ⇒ q; s ⇒ q; and t ⇒ q are proved, then ( r ∨ s ∨ t) ⇒ q, is proved and so p ⇒ q is proved
The method consists of examining every possible case of the hypothesis
It is practically convenient only when the number of possible cases are few
Example 4
Show that in any triangle ABC, a =b cos C + c cos B
Solution
Let p be the statement “ABC is any tria ngle” and q be the statement “a =b cos C + c cos B” Let ABC be a triangle
From A draw AD a perpendicular to BC (BC produced if necessary)
As we know that any triangle has to be either acute or obtuse or right angled, we can split p into three statements r, s and t, where PROOFS IN MA THEMA TICS 191 r : ABC is an acute angled triangle with ∠ C is acute
s : ABC is an obtuse angled triangle with ∠ C is obtuse
t : ABC is a right angled triangle with ∠ C is right angle
Hence, we prove the theorem by three cases
Case (i) When ∠ C is acute (Fig
A1.1)
From the right angled triangle ADB, BD AB =cos B i.e
BD = AB cos B =c cos B From the right angled triangle ADC, CD AC =cos C i.e
CD = AC cos C =b cos C Now a =BD + CD =c cos B + b cos C ..
(1) Case (ii) When ∠ C is obtuse (Fig A1.2)
From the right angled triangle ADB, BD AB =cos B i.e
BD = AB cos B =c cos B From the right angled triangle ADC, CD AC =cos ∠ ACD =cos (180° – C) =– cos C i.e
CD = – AC cos C =– b cos C Fig A1.1 Fig A1.2 MA THEMA TICS 192 Now a =BC = BD – CD i.e
a =c cos B – ( – b cos C) a =c cos B + b cos C ..
(2) Case (iii) When ∠ C is a right angle (Fig A1.3)
From the right angled triangle ACB, BC AB =cos B i.e
BC = AB cos B a =c cos B, and b cos C = b cos 900 = 0
Thus, we may write a =0 + c cos B =b cos C + c cos B ..
(3) From (1), (2) and (3)
We assert that for any triangle ABC, a =b cos C + c cos B By case (i), r ⇒ q is proved
By case (ii), s ⇒ q is proved
By case (iii), t ⇒ q is proved
Hence, from the proof by cases, ( r ∨ s ∨ t) ⇒ q is proved, i.e., p ⇒ q is proved
Indir ect Pr oof Instead of proving the given proposition directly , we establish the proof of the proposition through proving a proposition which is equivalent to the given proposition
(i)Proof by contradiction (Reductio Ad Absur dum) : Here, we start with the assumption that the given statement is false
By rules of logic, we arrive at a conclusion contradicting the assumption and hence it is inferred that the assumption is wrong and hence the given statement is true
Let us illustrate this method by an example
Example 5
Show that the set of all prime numbers is infinite
Solution
Let P be the set of all prime numbers
We take the negation of the statement “the set of all prime numbers is infinite”, i.e., we assume the set of all prime numbers to be finite
Hence, we can list all the prime numbers as P1, P2, P3,..., Pk (say)
Note that we have assumed that there is no prime number other than P1, P2, P3,..., Pk
Now consider N = (P1 P2 P3...Pk) + 1 ..
(1) N is not in the list as N is larger than any of the numbers in the list
N is either prime or composite
Fig A1.3 PROOFS IN MA THEMA TICS 193 If N is a prime, then by (1), there exists a prime number which is not listed
On the other hand, if N is composite, it should have a prime divisor
But none of the numbers in the list can divide N, because they all leave the remainder 1
Hence, the prime divisor should be other than the one in the list
Thus, in both the cases whether N is a prime or a composite, we ended up with contradiction to the fact that we have listed all the prime numbers
Hence, our assumption that set of all prime numbers is finite is false
Thus, the set of all prime numbers is infinite
ANote Observe that the above proof also uses the method of proof by cases
(ii) Proof by using contrapositive statement of the given statement Instead of proving the conditional p ⇒ q, we prove its equivalent, i.e., ~ q ⇒ ~ p
(students can verify)
The contrapositive of a conditional can be formed by interchanging the conclusion and the hypothesis and negating both
Example 6
Prove that the function f : R → →→ →→ R defined by f(x) = 2 x + 5 is one-one
Solution
A function is one-one if f(x1) = f(x2) ⇒ x1 = x2
Using this we have to show that “2x1+ 5 = 2 x2 + 5” ⇒ “x1 = x2”
This is of the form p ⇒ q, where , p is 2x1+ 5 = 2 x2 + 5 and q : x1 = x2
We have proved this in
Example 2
of “direct method”
We can also prove the same by using contrapositive of the statement
Now contrapositive of this statement is ~ q ⇒ ~ p, i.e., contrapositive of “if f(x1) = f(x2), then x1 = x2” is “if x1 ≠x2, then f(x1) ≠ f(x2)”
Now x1 ≠x2 ⇒ 2x1 ≠2x2 ⇒ 2x1+ 5 ≠2x2 + 5 ⇒ f(x1) ≠f(x2)
Since “~ q ⇒ ~ p”, is equivalent to “ p ⇒ q” the proof is complete
Example 7
Show that “if a matrix A is invertible, then A is non singular”
Solution
Writing the above statement in symbolic form, we have p ⇒ q, where, p is “matrix A is invertible” and q is “A is non singular” Instead of proving the given statement, we prove its contrapositive statement, i.e., if A is not a non singular matrix, then the matrix A is not invertible
MA THEMA TICS 194 If A is not a non singular matrix, then it means the matrix A is singular , i.e., |A| =0 Then A–1 =A |A|adj does not exist as |A| = 0 Hence, A is not invertible
Thus, we have proved that if A is not a non singular matrix, then A is not invertible
i.e., ~ q ⇒ ~ p
Henc e, if a matrix A is invertible, then A is non singular
(iii) Proof by a counter example In the history of Mathematics, there are occasions when all attempts to find a valid proof of a statement fail and the uncertainty of the truth value of the statement remains unresolved
In such a situation, it is beneficial, if we find an example to falsify the statement
The example to disprove the statement is called a counter example
Since the disproof of a proposition p ⇒ q is merely a proof of the proposition ~ ( p ⇒ q)
Hence, this is also a method of proof
Example 8
For each n, 1n+is a prime ( n ∈ N)
This was once thought to be true on the basis that 122 1+ = + 1 = 5 is a prime
222 1+ = + 1 = is a prime
322 1+ = + 1 = 257 is a prime
However , at first sight the generalisation looks to be correct
But, eventually it was shown that522 1+ =232 + 1 = 4294967297 which is not a prime since 4294967297 = 641 * 6700417 (a product of two numbers )
So the generalisation “For each n, 1n+ is a prime ( n ∈ N)” is false
Just this one example 522 1+ is sufficient to disprove the generalisation
This is the counter example
Thus, we have proved that the generalisation “For each n, 1n+ is a prime (n ∈ N)” is not true in general
PROOFS IN MA THEMA TICS 195
Example 9
Every continuous function is differentiable
Proof We consider some functions given by (i)f(x) = x2 (ii) g(x) = ex (iii) h(x) = sin x These functions are continuous for all values of x
If we check for their differentiability , we find that they are all dif ferentiable for all the values of x
This makes us to believe that the generalisation “Every continuous function is differentiable” may be true
But if we check the differentiability of the function given by “ φ(x) = |x|” which is continuous, we find that it is not differentiable at x = 0
This means that the statement “Every continuous function is differentiable” is false, in general
Just this one function “φ(x) = |x|” is sufficient to disprove the statement
Hence, “ φ(x) = |x|” is called a counter example to disprove “Every continuous function is differentiable”

A.2.1 Introduction
In class XI, we have learnt about mathematical modelling as an attempt to study some part (or form) of some real-life problems in mathematical terms, i.e., the conversion of a physical situation into mathematics using some suitable conditions
Roughly speaking mathematical modelling is an activity in which we make models to describe the behaviour of various phenomenal activities of our interest in many ways using words, drawings or sketches, computer programs, mathematical formulae etc
In earlier classes, we have observed that solutions to many problems, involving applications of various mathematical concepts, involve mathematical modelling in one way or the other
Therefore, it is important to study mathematical modelling as a separate topic
In this chapter , we shall further study mathematical modelling of some real-life problems using techniques/results from matrix, calculus and linear programming
A.2.2 Why
Mathematical Modelling? Students are aware of the solution of word problems in arithmetic, algebra, trigonometry and linear programming etc
Sometimes we solve the problems without going into the physical insight of the situational problems
Situational problems need physical insight that is introduction of physical laws and some symbols to compare the mathematical results obtained with practical values
To solve many problems faced by us, we need a technique and this is what is known as mathematical modelling
Let us consider the following problems : (i)To find the width of a river (particularly , when it is dif ficult to cross the river)
(ii) To find the optimal angle in case of shot-put (by considering the variables such as : the height of the thrower , resistance of the media, acceleration due to gravity etc.)
(iii) To find the height of a tower (particularly , when it is not possible to reach the top of the tower)
(iv) To find the temperature at the surface of the Sun.Appendix 2 MATHEMA TICAL MODELLING MATHEMATICAL MODELLING 197 (v) Why heart patients are not allowed to use lift? (without knowing the physiology of a human being)
(vi) To find the mass of the Earth
(vii) Estimate the yield of pulses in India from the standing crops (a person is not allowed to cut all of it)
(viii) Find the volume of blood inside the body of a person (a person is not allowed to bleed completely)
(ix) Estimate the population of India in the year 2020 (a person is not allowed to wait till then)
All of these problems can be solved and infact have been solved with the help of Mathematics using mathematical modelling
In fact, you might have studied the methods for solving some of them in the present textbook itself
However , it will be instructive if you first try to solve them yourself and that too without the help of Mathematics, if possible, you will then appreciate the power of Mathematics and the need for mathematical modelling
A.2.3 Principles
of Mathematical Modelling Mathematical modelling is a principled activity and so it has some principles behind it
These principles are almost philosophical in nature
Some of the basic principles of mathematical modelling are listed below in terms of instructions: (i)Identify the need for the model
(for what we are looking for) (ii) List the parameters/variables which are required for the model
(iii) Identify the available relevent data
(what is given?) (iv) Identify the circumstances that can be applied (assumptions) (v) Identify the governing physical principles
(vi) Identify (a)the equations that will be used
(b)the calculations that will be made
(c)the solution which will follow
(vii) Identify tests that can check the (a)consistency of the model
(b)utility of the model
(viii) Identify the parameter values that can improve the model
The above principles of mathematical modelling lead to the following: steps for mathematical modelling
Step 1: Identify the physical situation
Step 2: Convert the physical situation into a mathematical model by introducing parameters / variables and using various known physical laws and symbols
Step 3: Find the solution of the mathematical problem
Step 4: Interpret the result in terms of the original problem and compare the result with observations or experiments
Step 5: If the result is in good agreement, then accept the model
Otherwise modify the hypotheses / assumptions according to the physical situation and go to Step 2
The above steps can also be viewed through the following diagram: Fig
A.2.1 Example
1 Find the height of a given tower using mathematical modelling
Solution
Step 1 Given physical situation is “to find the height of a given tower”
Step 2 Let AB be the given tower (Fig A.2.2)
Let PQ be an observer measuring the height of the tower with his eye at P
Let PQ = h and let height of tower be H
Let α be the angle of elevation from the eye of the observer to the top of the tower
Fig
A.2.2 MATHEMATICAL
MODELLING 199 Let l =PC = QB Now tanα =AC H PCh l-= or H =h + l tan α ..
(1) Step 3 Note that the values of the parameters h, l and α (using sextant) are known to the observer and so (1) gives the solution of the problem
Step 4 In case, if the foot of the tower is not accessible, i.e., when l is not known to the observer , let β be the angle of depression from P to the foot B of the tower
So from ∆PQB, we have PQtanQBh lβ= = or l = h cot β Step 5 is not required in this situation as exact values of the parameters h, l, α and β are known
Example 2
Let a business firm produces three types of products P1, P2 and P3 that uses three types of raw materials R1, R2 and R3
Let the firm has purchase orders from two clients F1 and F2
Considering the situation that the firm has a limited quantity of R1, R2 and R3, respectively , prepare a model to determine the quantities of the raw material R1, R2 and R3 required to meet the purchase orders
Solution
S tep 1 The physical situation is well identified in the problem
Step 2 Let A be a matrix that represents purchase orders from the two clients F1 and F2
Then, A is of the form 1 2 3 1 2P P P F• • •AF• • • =   Let B be the matrix that represents the amount of raw materials R1, R2 and R3, required to manufacture each unit of the products P1, P2 and P3
Then, B is of the form 1 2 3 1 2 3R R R • • •P B P • • • P• • •   =     Step 3 Note that the product (which in this case is well defined) of matrices A and B is given by the following matrix 1 2 3 1 2R R R F• • •ABF• • • =   which in fact gives the desired quantities of the raw materials R1, R2 and R3 to fulfill the purchase orders of the two clients F1 and F2
Example 3
Interpret the model in
Example 2
, in case 3 4 010 6A = , B 7 9 310 7    =        and the available raw materials are 330 units of R1, 455 units of R2 and 140 units of R3
Solution
Note that AB =3 4 010 9 310 7           =RRR F F1 2 3 1 2165 247 170 220    This clearly shows that to meet the purchase order of F1 and F2, the raw material required is 335 units of R1, 467 units of R2 and 147 units of R3 which is much more than the available raw material
Since the amount of raw material required to manufacture each unit of the three products is fixed, we can either ask for an increase in the available raw material or we may ask the clients to reduce their orders
Remark If we replace A in
Example 3
by A1 given by A1 = 9 6 0     i.e., if the clients agree to reduce their purchase orders, then A1 B = 3 4 9 310 7           =  141 216 170 220 MATHEMATICAL MODELLING 201 This requires 1 units of R1, 436 units of R2 and 138 units of R3 which are well below the available raw materials, i.e., 330 units of R1, 455 units of R2 and 140 units of R3
Thus, if the revised purchase orders of the clients are given by A1, then the firm can easily supply the purchase orders of the two clients
ANote One may further modify A so as to make full use of the available raw material
Query Can we make a mathematical model with a given B and with fixed quantities of the available raw material that can help the firm owner to ask the clients to modify their orders in such a way that the firm makes the full use of its available raw material? The answer to this query is given in the following example:
Example 4
Suppose P1, P2, P3 and R1, R2, R3 are as in
Example 2
Let the firm has 330 units of R1, 455 units of R2 and 140 units of R3 available with it and let the amount of raw materials R1, R2 and R3 required to manufacture each unit of the three products is given by 1 2 3 1 2 3R R R 3 4 0P B P 7 9 3 P5 7   =     How many units of each product is to be made so as to utilise the full available raw material?
Solution
Step 1 The situation is easily identifiable
Step 2 Suppose the firm produces x units of P1, y units of P2 and z units of P3
Since product P1 requires 3 units of R1, P2 requires 7 units of R1 and P3 requires 5 units of R1 (observe matrix B) and the total number of units, of R1, available is 330, we have 3x + 7y + 5z =330 (for raw material R1) Similarly , we have 4x + 9y + z =455 (for raw material R2) and 3y + 7z =140 (for raw material R3) This system of equations can be expressed in matrix form as 3 7 5 4 9 0 3 7330 455 140            =      x y z Step 3 Using elementary row operations, we obtain 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 120 5            =      x y z This gives x = , y = and z = 5
Thus, the firm can produce units of P1, units of P2 and 5 units of P3 to make full use of its available raw material
Remark One may observe that if the manufacturer decides to manufacture according to the available raw material and not according to the purchase orders of the two clients F1 and F2 (as in
Example 3
), he/she is unable to meet these purchase orders as F1 demanded 6 units of P3 where as the manufacturer can make only 5 units of P3
Example 5
A manufacturer of medicines is preparing a production plan of medicines M1 and M2
There are sufficient raw materials available to make 20000 bottles of M1 and 40000 bottles of M2, but there are only 45000 bottles into which either of the medicines can be put
Further , it takes 3 hours to prepare enough material to fill 1000 bottles of M1, it takes 1 hour to prepare enough material to fill 1000 bottles of M2 and there are hours available for this operation
The profit is Rs 8 per bottle for M1 and Rs 7 per bottle for M2
How should the manufacturer schedule his/her production in order to maximise profit?
Solution
S tep 1 To find the number of bottles of M1 and M2 in order to maximise the profit under the given hypotheses
Step 2 Let x be the number of bottles of type M1 medicine and y be the number of bottles of type M2 medicine
Since profit is Rs 8 per bottle for M1 and Rs 7 per bottle for M2, therefore the objective function (which is to be maximised) is given by Z ≡ Z (x, y) = 8 x + 7y The objective function is to be maximised subject to the constraints (Refer Chapter on Linear Programming) x y x y x y x y≤ ≤ + ≤ + ≤ ≥ ≥     20000 40000 45000 3 66000 0 0 , ..
(1) Step 3 The shaded region OPQRST is the feasible region for the constraints (1) (Fig A.2.3)
The co-ordinates of vertices O, P , Q, R, S and T are (0, 0), (20000, 0), (20000, 6000), (10500, 34500), (5000, 40000) and (0, 40000), respectively
MATHEMATICAL MODELLING 203 Fig
A.2.3 Note
that Z at P (0, 0) = 0 Z at P (20000, 0) = 8 * 20000 = 160000 Z at Q (20000, 6000) = 8 * 20000 + 7 * 6000 = 202000 Z at R (10500, 34500) = 8 * 10500 + 7 * 34500 = 325500 Z at S = (5000, 40000) = 8 * 5000 + 7 * 40000 = 320000 Z at T = (0, 40000) = 7 * 40000 = 280000 Now observe that the profit is maximum at x = 10500 and y = 34500 and the maximum profit is ` 325500
Hence, the manufacturer should produce 10500 bottles of M1 medicine and 34500 bottles of M2 medicine in order to get maximum profit of ` 325500
Example 6
Suppose a company plans to produce a new product that incur some costs (fixed and variable) and let the company plans to sell the product at a fixed price
Prepare a mathematical model to examine the profitability
Solution
S tep 1 Situation is clearly identifiable
Step 2 Formulation: We are given that the costs are of two types: fixed and variable
The fixed costs are independent of the number of units produced (e.g., rent and rates), while the variable costs increase with the number of units produced (e.g., material)
Initially , we assume that the variable costs are directly proportional to the number of units produced — this should simplify our model
The company earn a certain amount of money by selling its products and wants to ensure that it is maximum
For convenience, we assume that all units produced are sold immediately
The mathematical model Let x =number of units produced and sold C =total cost of production (in rupees) I =income from sales (in rupees) P =profit (in rupees) Our assumptions above state that C consists of two parts: (i)fixed cost = a (in rupees), (ii) variable cost = b (rupees/unit produced)
Then C =a + bx ..
(1) Also, income I depends on selling price s (rupees/unit) Thus I =sx ..
(2) The profit P is then the difference between income and costs
So P =I – C =sx – (a + bx) =(s – b) x – a ..
(3) We now have a mathematical model of the r elationships (1) to (3) between the variables x, C, I, P, a, b, s
These variables may be classified as: independent x dependent C, I, P parameters a, b, s The manufacturer , knowing x, a, b, s can determine P
Step 3 From (3), we can observe that for the break even point (i.e., make neither profit nor loss), he must have P = 0, i.e., units.axs b=- Steps 4 and 5 In view of the break even point, one may conclude that if the company produces few units, i.e., less than unitsaxs b=-, then the company will suffer loss MATHEMATICAL MODELLING 205 and if it produces large number of units, i.e., much more than unitsa s b-, then it can make huge profit
Further , if the break even point proves to be unrealistic, then another model could be tried or the assumptions regarding cash flow may be modified
Remark From (3), we also have Pds bd x= - This means that rate of change of P with respect to x depends on the quantity s – b, which is the difference of selling price and the variable cost of each product
Thus, in order to gain profit, this should be positive and to get large gains, we need to produce large quantity of the product and at the same time try to reduce the variable cost
Example 7
Let a tank contains 1000 litres of brine which contains 250 g of salt per litre
Brine containing 200 g of salt per litre flows into the tank at the rate of litres per minute and the mixture flows out at the same rate
Assume that the mixture is kept uniform all the time by stirring
What would be the amount of salt in the tank at any time t?
Solution
S tep 1 The situation is easily identifiable
Step 2 Let y = y (t) denote the amount of salt (in kg) in the tank at time t (in minutes) after the inflow , outflow starts
Further assume that y is a dif ferentiable function
When t = 0, i.e., before the inflow–outflow of the brine starts, y = 250 g * 1000 = 250 kg Note that the change in y occurs due to the inflow , outflow of the mixture
Now the inflow of brine brings salt into the tank at the rate of 5 kg per minute (as * 200 g = 5 kg) and the outflow of brine takes salt out of the tank at the rate of 251000 y y  = kg per minute (as at time t, the salt in the tank is 1000ykg)
Thus, the rate of change of salt with respect to t is given by dy dt = 540y- (Why?) or1 dyydt+ = 5 ..
(1) This gives a mathematical model for the given problem
Step 3 Equation (1) is a linear equation and can be easily solved
The solution of (1) is given by 40200 Ct t y e e= + or y (t) = 200 + C t e- ..
(2) where, c is the constant of integration
Note that when t = 0, y = 250
Therefore, 250 = 200 + C or C = Then (2) reduces to y = 200 + t e- ..
(3) or200 y- = t e- ort e = 200y- Therefore t = 4050 200logE Y -  ..
(4) Here, the equation (4) gives the time t at which the salt in tank is y kg
Step 4 Since t e- is always positive, from (3), we conclude that y > 200 at all times Thus, the minimum amount of salt content in the tank is 200 kg
Also, from (4), we conclude that t > 0 if and only if 0 < y – 200 < i.e., if and only if 200 < y < 250 i.e., the amount of salt content in the tank after the start of inflow and outflow of the brine is between 200 kg and 250 kg
Limitations of Mathematical Modelling Till today many mathematical models have been developed and applied successfully to understand and get an insight into thousands of situations
Some of the subjects like mathematical physics, mathematical economics, operations research, bio-mathematics etc
are almost synonymous with mathematical modelling
But there are still a large number of situations which are yet to be modelled
The reason behind this is that either the situation are found to be very complex or the mathematical models formed are mathematically intractable
MATHEMATICAL MODELLING 207 The development of the powerful computers and super computers has enabled us to mathematically model a large number of situations (even complex situations)
Due to these fast and advanced computers, it has been possible to prepare more realistic models which can obtain better agreements with observations
However , we do not have good guidelines for choosing various parameters / variables and also for estimating the values of these parameters / variables used in a mathematical model
Infact, we can prepare reasonably accurate models to fit any data by choosing five or six parameters / variables
We require a minimal number of parameters / variables to be able to estimate them accurately
Mathematical modelling of large or complex situations has its own special problems
These type of situations usually occur in the study of world models of environment, oceanography , pollution control etc
Mathematical modellers from all disciplines — mathematics, computer science, physics, engineering, social sciences, etc., are involved in meeting these challenges with courage

GSM paper with NCERT watermark Published at the Publication Division by the Secretary, National Council of Ed ucational Research and Trainin g, Sri Aurobindo Marg, New Delhi 110 016 and printed at Amar Ujala Limited, C-, Sector-, Noida-201301 Foreword The National Curriculum Framework 2005, recommends that children’ s life at school must be linked to their life outside the school
This principle marks a departure from the legacy of bookish learning which continues to shape our system and causes a gap between the school, home and community
The syllabi and textbooks developed on the basis of NCF signify an attempt to implement this basic idea
They also attempt to discourage rote learning and the maintenance of sharp boundaries between dif ferent subject areas
We hope these measures will take us significantly further in the direction of a child-centred system of education outlined in the National Policy on Education (1986)
The success of this ef fort depends on the steps that school principals and teachers will take to encourage children to reflect on their own learning and to pursue imaginative activities and questions
We must recognise that, given space, time and freedom, children generate new knowledge by engaging with the information passed on to them by adults
Treating the prescribed textbook as the sole basis of examination is one of the key reasons why other resources and sites of learning are ignored
Inculcating creativity and initiative is possible if we perceive and treat children as participants in learning, not as receivers of a fixed body of knowledge
These aims imply considerable change in school routines and mode of functioning
Flexibility in the daily time-table is as necessary as rigour in implementing the annual calendar so that the required number of teaching days are actually devoted to teaching
The methods used for teaching and evaluation will also determine how ef fective this textbook proves for making children’ s life at school a happy experience, rather than a source of stress or boredom
Syllabus designers have tried to address the problem of curricular burden by restructuring and reorienting knowledge at dif ferent stages with greater consideration for child psychology and the time available for teaching
The textbook attempts to enhance this endeavour by giving higher priority and space to opportunities for contemplation and wondering, discussion in small groups, and activities requiring hands-on experience
NCER T appreciates the hard work done by the textbook development committee responsible for this book
We wish to thank the Chairperson of the advisory group in Science and Mathematics, Professor J.V
Narlikar and the Chief Advisor for this book, Professor P .K
Jain for guiding the work of this committee
Several teachers contributed to the development of this textbook; we are grateful to their principals for making this possible
We are indebted to the institutions and or ganisations which have generously permitted us to draw upon their resources, material and personnel
As an or ganisation committed to systemic reform and continuous improvement in the quality of its products, NCER T welcomes comments and suggestions which will enable us to undertake further revision and refinement
Director New Delhi National Council of Educational December 2005 Research and Training Rationalisation of Content in the Textbook In view of the COVID- pandemic, it is imperative to reduce content load on students
The National Education Policy 2020, also emphasises reducing the content load and providing opportunities for experiential learning with creative mindset
In this background, the NCER T has undertaken the exercise to rationalise the textbooks across all classes
Learning Outcomes already developed by the NCER T across classes have been taken into consideration in this exercise
Contents of the textbooks have been rationalised in view of the following: •Overlapping with similar content included in other subject areas in the same class •Similar content included in the lower or higher class in the same subject •Difficulty level •Content, which is easily accessible to students without much interventions from teachers and can be learned by children through self-learning or peer- learning •Content, which is irrelevant in the present context This present edition, is a reformatted version after carrying out the changes given above
Preface The National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCER T) had constituted Focus Groups on Teaching of various subjects related to School Education, to review the National Curriculum Framework for School Education - 2000 (NCFSE - 2000) in face of new emer ging challenges and transformations occurring in the fields of content and pedagogy under the contexts of National and International spectrum of school education
These Focus Groups made general and specific comments in their respective areas
Consequently , based on these reports of Focus Groups, National Curriculum Framework (NCF)-2005 was developed
NCER T designed the new syllabi and constituted Textbook Development Teams for Classes XI and XII to prepare textbooks in mathematics under the new guidelines and new syllabi
The textbook for Class XI is already in use, which was brought in 2005
The first draft of the present book (Class XII) was prepared by the team consisting of NCER T faculty , experts and practicing teachers
The draft was refined by the development team in different meetings
This draft of the book was exposed to a group of practicing teachers teaching mathematics at higher secondary stage in different parts of the country , in a review workshop or ganised by the NCER T at Delhi
The teachers made useful comments and suggestions which were incorporated in the draft textbook
The draft textbook was finalised by an editorial board constituted out of the development team
Finally , the Advisory Group in Science and Mathematics and the Monitoring Committee constituted by the HRD Ministry , Government of India have approved the draft of the textbook
In the fitness of things, let us cite some of the essential features dominating the textbook
These characteristics have reflections in almost all the chapters
The existing textbook contain main chapters and two appendices
Each Chapter contain the followings: §Introduction: Highlighting the importance of the topic; connection with earlier studied topics; brief mention about the new concepts to be discussed in the chapter
§Organisation of chapter into sections comprising one or more concepts/sub concepts
§Motivating and introducing the concepts/sub concepts
Illustrations have been provided wherever possible
§Proofs/problem solving involving deductive or inductive reasoning, multiplicity of approaches wherever possible have been inducted
§Geometric viewin g/visualisation of concepts have been emphasised whenever needed

§Adequate and variety of examples/exercises have been given in each section
§For refocusing and strengthening the understanding and skill of problem solving and applicabilities, miscellaneous types of examples/exercises have been provided involving two or more sub concepts at a time at the end of the chapter
The scope of challenging problems to talented minority have been reflected conducive to the recommendation as reflected in NCF-2005
§For more motivational purpose, brief historical background of topics have been provided at the end of the chapter and at the beginning of each chapter relevant quotation and photograph of eminent mathematician who have contributed significantly in the development of the topic undertaken, are also provided

HARDY 1.1 Introduction Recall that the notion of relations and functions, domain, co-domain and range have been introduced in Class XI along with different types of specific real valued functions and their graphs
The concept of the term ‘relation’ in mathematics has been drawn from the meaning of relation in English language, according to which two objects or quantities are related if there is a recognisable connection or link between the two objects or quantities
Let A be the set of students of Class XII of a school and B be the set of students of Class XI of the same school
Then some of the examples of relations from A to B are (i){(a, b) ∈A * B: a is brother of b}, (ii) {(a, b) ∈A * B: a is sister of b}, (iii) {(a, b) ∈A * B: age of a is greater than age of b}, (iv) {(a, b) ∈A * B: total marks obtained by a in the final examination is less than the total marks obtained by b in the final examination}, (v) {(a, b) ∈ A * B: a lives in the same locality as b}
However , abstracting from this, we define mathematically a relation R from A to B as an arbitrary subset of A * B
If (a, b) ∈ R, we say that a is related to b under the relation R and we write as a R b
In general, ( a, b) ∈ R, we do not bother whether there is a recognisable connection or link between a and b
As seen in Class XI, functions are special kind of relations
In this chapter , we will study dif ferent types of relations and functions, composition of functions, invertible functions and bin ary operations.Chapter 1 RELA TIONS AND FUNCTIONS Lejeune Dirichlet (1805-1859) Reprint 2025- 2 1.2 Types of Relations In this section, we would like to study dif ferent types of relations
We know that a relation in a set A is a subset of A * A
Thus, the empty set φ and A * A are two extreme relations
For illustration, consider a relation R in the set A = {1, 2, 3, 4} given by R = {( a, b): a – b = }
This is the empty set, as no pair ( a, b) satisfies the condition a – b =
Similarly , R′ = {( a, b) : | a – b | ≥ 0} is the whole set A * A, as all pairs (a, b) in A * A satisfy | a – b | ≥ 0
These two extreme examples lead us to the following definitions
Definition 1 A relation R in a set A is called empty r elation , if no element of A is related to any element of A, i.e., R = φ ⊂ A * A
Definition 2 A relation R in a set A is called universal r elation , if each element of A is related to every element of A, i.e., R = A * A
Both the empty relation and the universal relation are some times called trivial relations
Example 1
Let A be the set of all students of a boys school
Show that the relation R in A given by R = {( a, b) : a is sister of b} is the empty relation and R ′ = {( a, b) : the difference between heights of a and b is less than 3 meters} is the universal relation
Solution
Since the school is boys school, no student of the school can be sister of any student of the school
Hence, R = φ, showing that R is the empty relation
It is also obvious that the difference between heights of any two students of the school has to be less than 3 meters
This shows that R ′ = A * A is the universal relation
Remark In Class XI, we have seen two ways of representing a relation, namely raster method and set builder method
However , a relation R in the set {1, 2, 3, 4} defined by R = {( a, b) : b = a + 1} is also expressed as a R b if and only if b = a + 1 by many authors
We may also use this notation, as and when convenient
If (a, b) ∈ R, we say that a is related to b and we denote it as a R b
One of the most important relation, which plays a significant role in Mathematics, is an equivalence r elation
To study equivalence relation, we first consider three types of relations, namely reflexive, symmetric and transitive
Definition 3 A relation R in a set A is called (i)reflexive , if (a, a) ∈ R, for every a ∈ A, (ii) symmetric , if (a1, a2) ∈ R implies that ( a2, a1) ∈ R, for all a1, a2 ∈ A
(iii) transitive , if (a1, a2) ∈ R and ( a2, a3) ∈ R implies that ( a1, a3) ∈ R, for all a1, a2, a3 ∈ A
RELA TIONS AND FUNCTIONS 3 Definition 4 A relation R in a set A is said to be an equivalence r elation if R is reflexive, symmetric and transitive
Example 2
Let T be the set of all triangles in a plane with R a relation in T given by R = {(T1, T2) : T1 is congruent to T2}
Show that R is an equivalence relation
Solution
R is reflexive, since every triangle is congruent to itself
Further , (T1, T2) ∈ R ⇒ T1 is congruent to T2 ⇒ T2 is congruent to T1 ⇒ (T2, T1) ∈ R
Hence, R is symmetric
Moreover , (T1, T2), (T2, T3) ∈ R ⇒ T1 is congruent to T2 and T2 is congruent to T3 ⇒ T1 is congruent to T3 ⇒ (T1, T3) ∈ R
Therefore, R is an equivalence relation
Example 3
Let L be the set of all lines in a plane and R be the relation in L defined as R = {(L1, L2) : L1 is perpendicular to L2}
Show that R is symmetric but neither reflexive nor transitive
Solution
R is not reflexive, as a line L1 can not be perpendicular to itself, i.e., (L1, L1) ∉ R
R is symmetric as (L1, L2) ∈ R ⇒ L1 is perpendicular to L2 ⇒ L2 is perpendicular to L1 ⇒ (L2, L1) ∈ R
R is not transitive
Indeed, if L1 is perpendicular to L2 and L2 is perpendicular to L3, then L1 can never be perpendicular to L3
In fact, L1 is parallel to L3, i.e., (L1, L2) ∈ R, (L2, L3) ∈ R but (L1, L3) ∉ R
Example 4
Show that the relation R in the set {1, 2, 3} given by R = {(1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (1, 2), (2, 3)} is reflexive but neither symmetric nor transitive
Solution
R is reflexive, since (1, 1), (2, 2) and (3, 3) lie in R
Also, R is not symmetric, as (1, 2) ∈ R but (2, 1) ∉ R
Similarly , R is not transitive, as (1, 2) ∈ R and (2, 3) ∈ R but (1, 3) ∉ R
Example 5
Show that the relation R in the set Z of integers given by R = {( a, b) : 2 divides a – b} is an equivalence relation
Solution
R is reflexive, as 2 divides ( a – a) for all a ∈ Z
Further , if (a, b) ∈ R, then 2 divides a – b
Therefore, 2 divides b – a
Hence, ( b, a) ∈ R, which shows that R is symmetric
Similarly , if (a, b) ∈ R and ( b, c) ∈ R, then a – b and b – c are divisible by 2
Now , a – c = (a – b) + (b – c) is even (Why?)
So, ( a – c) is divisible by 2
This shows that R is transitive
Thus, R is an equivalence relation in Z.Fig 1.1 Reprint 2025- 4 In
Example 5
, note that all even integers are related to zero, as (0, ± 2), (0, ± 4) etc., lie in R and no odd integer is related to 0, as (0, ± 1), (0, ± 3) etc., do not lie in R
Similarly , all odd integers are related to one and no even integer is related to one
Therefore, the set E of all even integers and the set O of all odd integers are subsets of Z satisfying following conditions: (i)All elements of E are related to each other and all elements of O are related to each other
(ii) No element of E is related to any element of O and vice-versa
(iii) E and O are disjoint and Z = E ∪ O
The subset E is called the equivalence class containing zer o and is denoted by [0]
Similarly , O is the equivalence class containing 1 and is denoted by [1]
Note that [0] ≠ [1], [0] = [2 r] and [1] = [2 r + 1], r ∈ Z
Infact, what we have seen above is true for an arbitrary equivalence relation R in a set X
Given an arbitrary equivalence relation R in an arbitrary set X, R divides X into mutually disjoint subsets Ai called partitions or subdivisions of X satisfying: (i)all elements of Ai are related to each other , for all i
(ii) no element of Ai is related to any element of Aj, i ≠ j
(iii) ∪ Aj = X and Ai ∩ Aj = φ, i ≠ j
The subsets Ai are called equivalence classes
The interesting part of the situation is that we can go reverse also
For example, consider a subdivision of the set Z given by three mutually disjoint subsets A1, A2 and A3 whose union is Z with A1 = {x ∈ Z : x is a multiple of 3} = {..., – 6, – 3, 0, 3, 6, ...} A2 = {x ∈ Z : x – 1 is a multiple of 3} = {..., – 5, – 2, 1, 4, 7, ...} A3 = {x ∈ Z : x – 2 is a multiple of 3} = {..., – 4, – 1, 2, 5, 8, ...} Define a relation R in Z given by R = {( a, b) : 3 divides a – b}
Following the arguments similar to those used in
Example 5
, we can show that R is an equivalence relation
Also, A1 coincides with the set of all integers in Z which are related to zero, A2 coincides with the set of all integers which are related to 1 and A3 coincides with the set of all integers in Z which are related to 2
Thus, A1 = [0], A2 = [1] and A3 = [2]
In fact, A1 = [3 r], A2 = [3 r + 1] and A3 = [3 r + 2], for all r ∈ Z
Example 6
Let R be the relation defined in the set A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7} by R = {( a, b) : both a and b are either odd or even}
Show that R is an equivalence relation
Further , show that all the elements of the subset {1, 3, 5, 7} are related to each other and all the elements of the subset {2, 4, 6} are related to each other , but no element of the subset {1, 3, 5, 7} is related to any element of the subse t {2, 4, 6}
RELA TIONS AND FUNCTIONS 5
Solution
Given any element a in A, both a and a must be either odd or even, so that (a, a) ∈ R
Further , (a, b) ∈ R ⇒ both a and b must be either o dd or even ⇒ (b, a) ∈ R
Similarly , (a, b) ∈ R and (b, c) ∈ R ⇒ all elements a, b, c, must be either even or odd simultaneously ⇒ (a, c) ∈ R
Hence, R is an equivalence relation
Further , all the elements of {1, 3, 5, 7} are related to each other , as all the elements of this subset are odd
Similarly , all the elements of the subset {2, 4, 6} are related to each other , as all of them are even
Also, no element of the subset {1, 3, 5, 7} can be related to any element of {2, 4, 6}, as elements of {1, 3, 5, 7} are odd, while elements of {2, 4, 6} are even

along with their graphs have been given in Class XI
Addition, subtraction, multiplication and division of two functions have also been studied
As the concept of function is of paramount importance in mathematics and among other disciplines as well, we would like to extend our study about function from where we finished earlier
In this section, we would like to study dif ferent types of functions
Consider the functions f1, f2, f3 and f4 given by the following diagrams
In Fig 1.2, we observe that the images of distinct elements of X1 under the function f1 are distinct, but the image of two distinct elements 1 and 2 of X1 under f2 is same, namely b
Further , there are some elements like e and f in X2 which are not images of any element of X1 under f1, while all elements of X3 are images of some elements of X1 under f3
The above observations lead to the following definitions: Definition 5 A function f : X → Y is defined to be one-one (or injective ), if the images of distinct elements of X under f are distinct, i.e., for every x1, x2 ∈ X, f(x1) = f(x2) implies x1 = x2
Otherwise, f is called many-one
The function f1 and f4 in Fig 1.2 (i) and (iv) are one-one and the function f2 and f3 in Fig 1.2 (ii) and (iii) are many-one
Definition 6 A function f : X → Y is said to be onto (or surjective ), if every element of Y is the image of some element of X under f, i.e., for every y ∈ Y, there exists an element x in X such that f(x) = y
The function f3 and f4 in Fig 1.2 (iii), (iv) are onto and the function f1 in Fig 1.2 (i) is not onto as elements e, f in X2 are not the image of any element in X1 under f1
Reprint 2025- 8 Remark f : X → Y is onto if and only if Range of f = Y
Definition 7 A function f : X → Y is said to be one-one and onto (or bijective ), if f is both one-one and onto
The function f4 in Fig 1.2 (iv) is one-one and onto
Example 7
Let A be the set of all students of Class X in a school
Let f : A → N be function defined by f(x) = roll number of the student x
Show that f is one-one but not onto
Solution
No two dif ferent students of the class can have same roll number
Therefore, f must be one-one
We can assume without any loss of generality that roll numbers of students are from 1 to
This implies that in N is not roll number of any student of the class, so that can not be image of any element of X under f
Hence , f is not onto
Example 8
Show that the function f : N → N, given by f(x) = 2 x, is one-one but not onto
Solution
The function f is one-one, for f(x1) = f(x2) ⇒ 2x1 = 2x2 ⇒ x1 = x2
Further , f is not onto, as for 1 ∈ N, there does not exist any x in N such that f(x) = 2 x = 1.Fig 1.2 (i) to (iv) RELA TIONS AND FUNCTIONS 9
Example 9
Prove that the function f : R → R, given by f(x) = 2x, is one-one and onto
Solution
f is one-one, as f(x1) = f(x2) ⇒ 2x1 = 2x2 ⇒ x1 = x2
Also, given any real number y in R, there exists 2y in R such that f(2y) = 2
(2y) = y
Hence , f is onto
Fig 1.3
Example 1
0 Show that the function f : N → N, given by f(1) = f(2) = 1 and f(x) = x – 1, for every x > 2, is onto but not one-one
Solution
f is not one-one, as f(1) = f(2) = 1
But f is onto, as given any y ∈ N, y ≠ 1, we can choose x as y + 1 such that f(y + 1) = y + 1 – 1 = y
Also for 1 ∈ N, we have f(1) = 1
Example 1
1 Show that the function f : R → R, defined as f(x) = x2, is neither one-one nor onto
Solution
Since f(– 1) = 1 = f(1), f is not one- one
Also, the element – 2 in the co-domain R is not image of any element x in the domain R (Why?)
Therefore f is not onto
Example Show that f : N → N, given by 1,if is odd,( )1,if is evenx xf xx x+ = - is both one-one and onto
Fig 1.4 Reprint 2025-
Solution
Suppose f(x1) = f(x2)
Note that if x1 is odd and x2 is even, then we will have x1 + 1 = x2 – 1, i.e., x2 – x1 = 2 which is impossible
Similarly , the possibility of x1 being even and x2 being odd can also be ruled out, using the similar argument
Therefore, both x1 and x2 must be either odd or even
Suppose both x1 and x2 are odd
Then f(x1) = f(x2) ⇒ x1 + 1 = x2 + 1 ⇒ x1 = x2
Similarly, if both x1 and x2 are even, then also f(x1) = f(x2) ⇒ x1 – 1 = x2 – 1 ⇒ x1 = x2
Thus, f is one-one
Also, any odd number 2r + 1 in the co-domain N is the image of 2 r + 2 in the domain N and any even number 2r in the co-domain N is the image of 2 r – 1 in the domain N
Thus, f is onto
Example Show that an onto function f : {1, 2, 3} → {1, 2, 3} is always one-one
Solution
Suppose f is not one-one
Then there exists two elements, say 1 and 2 in the domain whose image in the co-domain is same
Also, the image of 3 under f can be only one element
Therefore, the range set can have at the most two elements of the co-domain {1, 2, 3}, showing that f is not onto, a contradiction
Hence , f must be one-one
Example Show that a one-one function f : {1, 2, 3} → {1, 2, 3} must be onto
Solution
Since f is one-one, three elements of {1, 2, 3} must be taken to 3 different elements of the co-domain {1, 2, 3} under f
Hence, f has to be onto
Remark The results mentioned in Examples and are also true for an arbitrary finite set X, i.e., a one-one function f : X → X is necessarily onto and an onto map f : X → X is necessarily one-one, for every finite set X
In contrast to this, Examples 8 and show that for an infinite set, this may not be true
In fact, this is a characteristic difference between a finite and an infinite set

Reprint 2025- 1.4 Composition of Functions and Invertible Function Definition 8 Let f : A → B and g : B → C be two functions
Then the composition of f and g, denoted by gof, is defined as the function gof : A → C given by gof(x) =g(f(x)), ∀ x ∈ A
Fig 1.5 Example Let f : {2, 3, 4, 5} → {3, 4, 5, 9} and g : {3, 4, 5, 9} → {7, 1 1, } be functions defined as f(2) = 3, f(3) = 4, f(4) = f(5) = 5 and g(3) = g(4) = 7 and g(5) = g(9) = 1 1
Find gof
Solution
We have gof(2) = g(f(2)) = g(3) = 7, gof(3) = g(f(3)) = g(4) = 7, gof(4) = g(f(4)) = g(5) = 1 1 and gof(5) = g(5) = 1 1
Example 1
6 Find gof and fog, if f : R → R and g : R → R are given by f(x) = cos x and g(x) = 3 x2
Show that gof ≠ fog
Solution
We have gof(x) = g(f(x)) = g(cos x) = 3 (cos x)2 = 3 cos2 x
Similarly , fog(x) = f(g(x)) = f(3x2) = cos (3 x2)
Note that 3cos2 x ≠ cos 3 x2, for x = 0
Hence, gof ≠ fog
Definition 9 A function f : X → Y is defined to be inver tible, if there exists a function g : Y → X such that gof = IX and fog = IY
The function g is called the inverse of f and is denoted by f–1
Thus, if f is invertible, then f must be one-one and onto and conversely , if f is one-one and onto, then f must be invertible
This fact significantly helps for proving a function f to be invertible by showing that f is one-one and onto, specially when the actual inverse of f is not to b e determined
Example Let f : N → Y be a function defined as f(x) = 4 x + 3, where , Y = { y ∈ N: y = 4x + 3 for some x ∈ N}
Show that f is invertible
Find the inverse
Solution
Consider an arbitrary element y of Y
By the definition of Y, y = 4x + 3, for some x in the domain N
This shows that ( 3) 4yx-=
Define g : Y → N by RELA TIONS AND FUNCTIONS ( 3)( )4yg y-=
Now , gof(x) = g(f(x)) = g(4x + 3) = (4 3 3) 4xx+ -= and fog(y) = f(g(y)) = f( 3) 4 ( 3) 4y y- - = +    = y – 3 + 3 = y
This shows that gof = IN and fog = IY, which implies that f is invertible and g is the inverse of f
Miscellaneous Examples Example If R1 and R2 are equivalence relations in a set A, show that R1 ∩ R2 is also an equivalence relation
Solution
Since R1 and R2 are equivalence relation s, (a, a) ∈ R1, and ( a, a) ∈ R2 ∀a ∈ A
This implies that (a, a) ∈ R1 ∩ R2, ∀a, showing R1 ∩ R2 is reflexive
Further , (a, b) ∈ R1 ∩ R2 ⇒ (a, b) ∈ R1 and (a, b) ∈ R2 ⇒ (b, a) ∈ R1 and (b, a) ∈ R2 ⇒ (b, a) ∈ R1 ∩ R2, hence, R1 ∩ R2 is symmetric
Similarly , (a, b) ∈ R1 ∩ R2 and (b, c) ∈ R1 ∩ R2 ⇒ (a, c) ∈ R1 and ( a, c) ∈ R2 ⇒ (a, c) ∈ R1 ∩ R2
This shows that R1 ∩ R2 is transitive
Thus, R1 ∩ R2 is an equiva lence relation
Example Let R be a relation on the set A of ordered pairs of positive integers defined by ( x, y) R (u,) if and only if xv = yu
Show that R is an equivalence relation
Solution
Clearly , (x, y) R ( x, y), ∀(x, y) ∈ A, since xy = yx
This shows that R is reflexive
Further , (x, y) R (u,) ⇒ xv = yu ⇒ uy = vx and hence ( u,) R (x, y)
This shows that R is symmetric
Similarly , (x, y) R (u,) and ( u,) R (a, b) ⇒ xv = yu and ub = va ⇒ a axv yuu u= ⇒ b axv yuv u= ⇒ xb = ya and hence ( x, y) R (a, b)
Thus, R is transitive
Thus, R is an equivalence relation
Example Let X = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Let R1 be a relation in X given by R1 = {( x, y) : x – y is divisible by 3} and R2 be another relation on X given by R2 = {(x, y): {x, y} ⊂ {1, 4, 7}} or { x, y} ⊂ {2, 5, 8} or { x, y} ⊂ {3, 6, 9}}
Show that R1 = R2
Solution
Note that the characteristic of sets {1, 4, 7}, {2, 5, 8} and {3, 6, 9} is that difference between any two elements of these sets is a multiple of 3
Therefore, (x, y) ∈ R1 ⇒ x – y is a multiple of 3 ⇒ {x, y} ⊂ {1, 4, 7} or { x, y} ⊂ {2, 5, 8} or {x, y} ⊂ {3, 6, 9} ⇒ (x, y) ∈ R2
Hence, R1 ⊂ R2
Similarly , {x, y} ∈ R2 ⇒ {x, y} Reprint 2025- ⊂ {1, 4, 7} or { x, y} ⊂ {2, 5, 8} or { x, y} ⊂ {3, 6, 9} ⇒ x – y is divisible by 3 ⇒ {x, y} ∈ R1
This shows that R2 ⊂ R1
Hence, R1 = R2
Example Let f : X → Y be a function
Define a relation R in X given by R = {( a, b): f(a) = f(b)}
Examine whether R is an equivalence relation or not
Solution
For every a ∈ X, (a, a) ∈ R, since f(a) = f(a), showing that R is reflexive
Similarly , (a, b) ∈ R ⇒ f(a) = f(b) ⇒ f(b) = f(a) ⇒ (b, a) ∈ R
Therefore, R is symmetric
Further , (a, b) ∈ R and ( b, c) ∈ R ⇒ f(a) = f(b) and f(b) = f(c) ⇒ f(a) = f(c) ⇒ (a, c) ∈ R, which implies that R is transitive
Hence, R is an equivalence relation
Example Find the number of all one-one functions from set A = {1, 2, 3} to itself
Solution
One-one function from {1, 2, 3} to itself is simply a permutation on three symbols 1, 2, 3
Therefore, total number of one-one maps from {1, 2, 3} to itself is same as total number of permutations on three symbols 1, 2, 3 which is 3! = 6
Example Let A = {1, 2, 3}
Then show that the number of relations containing (1, 2) and (2, 3) which are reflexive and transitive but not symmetric is three
Solution
The smallest relation R1 containing (1, 2) and (2, 3) which is reflexive and transitive but not symmetric is {(1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (1, 2), (2, 3), (1, 3)}
Now , if we add the pair (2, 1) to R1 to get R2, then the relation R2 will be reflexive, transitive but not symmetric
Similarly , we can obtain R3 by adding (3, 2) to R1 to get the desired relation
However , we can not add two pairs (2, 1), (3, 2) or single pair (3, 1) to R1 at a time, as by doing so, we will be forced to add the remaining pair in order to maintain transitivity and in the process, the relation will become symmetric also which is not required
Thus, the total number of desired relations is three
Example Show that the number of equivalence relation in the set {1, 2, 3} containing (1, 2) and (2, 1) is two
Solution
The smallest equivalence relation R1 containing (1, 2) and (2, 1) is {(1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (1, 2), (2, 1)}
Now we are left with only 4 pairs namely (2, 3), (3, 2), (1, 3) and (3, 1)
If we add any one, say (2, 3) to R1, then for symmetry we must add (3, 2) also and now for transitivity we are forced to add (1, 3) and (3, 1)
Thus, the only equivalence relation bigger than R1 is the universal relation
This shows that the total number of equivalence relations containing (1, 2) and (2, 1) is two
Example Consider the identity function IN : N → N defined as IN (x) = x ∀x ∈ N
Show that although IN is onto but IN + IN : N → N defined as (IN + IN) (x) = IN (x) + IN (x) = x + x = 2x is not onto
RELA TIONS AND FUNCTIONS
Solution
Clearly IN is onto
But IN + IN is not onto, as we can find an element 3 in the co-domain N such that there does not exist any x in the domain N with (IN + IN) (x) = 2 x = 3
Example Consider a function f : 0,2π →  Rgiven by f(x) = sin x and g : 0,2π →  Rgiven by g(x) = cos x
Show that f and g are one-one, but f + g is not one-one
Solution
Since for any two distinct elements x1 and x2 in 0,2π    , sin x1 ≠ sin x2 and cos x1 ≠ cos x2, both f and g must be one-one
But ( f + g) (0) = sin 0 + cos 0 = 1 and (f + g) 2π    = sin cos 2π π+ =
Therefore, f + g is not one-one

This is the characteristic property of a finite set
This is not true for infinite set RELA TIONS AND FUNCTIONS —vv—Historical Note The concept of function has evolved over a long period of time starting from R
Descartes (1596-1650), who used the word ‘function’ in his manuscript “Geometrie ” in 1637 to mean some positive integral power xn of a variable x while studying geometrical curves like hyperbola, parabola and ellipse
James Gregory (1636-1675) in his work “ Vera Cir culi et Hyperbolae Quadratura ” (1667) considered function as a quantity obtained from other quantities by successive use of algebraic operations or by any other operations
Later G
W
Leibnitz (1646-1716) in his manuscript “ Methodus tangentium inversa, seu de functionibus ” written in 1673 used the word ‘function’ to mean a quantity varying from point to point on a curve such as the coordinates of a point on the curve, the slope of the curve, the tangent and the normal to the curve at a point
However , in his manuscript “ Historia ” (1714), Leibnitz used the word ‘function’ to mean quantities that depend on a variable
He was the first to use the phrase ‘function of x’
John Bernoulli (1667-1748) used the notation φx for the first time in 1718 to indicate a function of x
But the general adoption of symbols like f, F, φ, ψ ..
to represent functions was made by Leonhard Euler (1707-1783) in 1734 in the first part of his manuscript “ Analysis Infinitorium ”
Later on, Joeph Louis Lagrange (1736-1813) published his manuscripts “ Theorie des functions analytiques ” in 1793, where he discussed about analytic function and used the notion f(x), F(x), φ(x) etc
for dif ferent function of x
Subsequently , Lejeunne Dirichlet (1805-1859) gave the definition of function which was being used till the set theoretic definition of function presently used, was given after set theory was developed by Georg Cantor (1845-1918)
The set theoretic definition of function known to us presently is simply an abstraction of the definition given by Dirichlet in a rigorous manner
vMathematics, in general, is fundamentally the science of self-evident things
— FELIX KLEIN 2.1 Introduction In Chapter 1, we have studied that the inverse of a function f, denoted by f–1, exists if f is one-one and onto
There are many functions which are not one-one, onto or both and hence we can not talk of their inverses
In Class XI, we studied that trigonometric functions are not one-one and onto over their natural domains and ranges and hence their inverses do not exist
In this chapter , we shall study about the restrictions on domains and ranges of trigonometric functions which ensure the existence of their inverses and observe their behaviour through graphical representations
Besides, some elementary properties will also be discussed
The inverse trigonometric functions play an important role in calculus for they serve to define many integrals
The concepts of inverse trigonometric functions is also used in science and engineering
2.2 Basic Concepts In Class XI, we have studied trigonometric functions, which are defined as follows: sine function, i.e., sine : R → [– 1, 1] cosine function, i.e., cos : R → [– 1, 1] tangent function, i.e., tan : R – { x : x = (2 n + 1) 2π, n ∈ Z} → R cotangent function, i.e., cot : R – { x : x = nπ, n ∈ Z} → R secant function, i.e., sec : R – { x : x = (2 n + 1) 2π, n ∈ Z} → R – (– 1, 1) cosecant function, i.e., cosec : R – { x : x = nπ, n ∈ Z} → R – (– 1, 1)Chapter 2 INVERSE TRIGONOMETRIC FUNCTIONS Aryabhata (476-550 A
D.) INVERSE TRIGONOMETRIC FUNCTIONS We have also learnt in Chapter 1 that if f : X→Y such that f(x) = y is one-one and onto, then we can define a unique function g : Y→X such that g(y) = x, where x ∈ X and y = f(x), y ∈ Y
Here, the domain of g = range of f and the range of g = domain of f
The function g is called the inverse of f and is denoted by f–1
Further , g is also one-one and onto and inverse of g is f
Thus, g–1 = (f –1)–1 = f
We also have (f –1 o f ) (x) = f –1 (f (x)) = f –1(y) = x and (f o f –1) (y) = f (f –1(y)) = f(x) = y Since the domain of sine function is the set of all real numbers and range is the closed interval [–1, 1]
If we restrict its domain to ,2 2-π π    , then it becomes one-one and onto with range [– 1, 1]
Actually , sine function restricted to any of the intervals -  3 2 2π π,  , ,2 2-π π    , 3,2 2π π    etc., is one-one and its range is [–1, 1]
We can, therefore, define the inverse of sine function in each of these intervals
We denote the inverse of sine function by sin–1 (arc sine function)
Thus, sin–1 is a function whose domain is [– 1, 1] and range could be any of the intervals 3,2 2- π -π    , ,2 2-π π     or 3,2 2π π    , and so on
Corresponding to each such interval, we get a branch of the function sin–1
The branch with range ,2 2-π π     is called the principal value branch, wher eas other inter vals as range give differ ent branches of sin–1
When we refer to the function sin–1, we take it as the function whose domain is [–1, 1] and range is ,2 2-π π
We write sin–1 : [–1, 1] → ,2 2-π π     From the definition of the inverse functions, it follows that sin (sin–1 x) = x if – 1 ≤ x ≤ 1 and sin–1 (sin x) = x if 2 2xπ π- ≤ ≤
In other words, if y = sin–1 x, then sin y = x
Remarks (i)We know from Chapter 1, that if y = f(x) is an invertible function, then x = f –1 (y)
Thus, the graph of sin–1 function can be obtained from the graph of original function by interchanging x and y axes, i.e., if ( a, b) is a point on the graph of sine function, then ( b, a) becomes the corresponding point on the graph of inverse of sine function
Thus, the graph of the function y = sin–1 x can be obtained from the graph of y = sin x by interchanging x and y axes
The graphs of y = sin x and y = sin–1 x are as given in Fig 2.1 (i), (ii), (iii)
The dark portion of the graph of y = sin–1 x represent the principal value branch
(ii) It can be shown that the graph of an inverse function can be obtained from the corresponding graph of original function as a mirror image (i.e., reflection) along the line y = x
This can be visualised by looking the graphs of y = sin x and y = sin–1 x as given in the same axes (Fig 2.1 (iii))
Like sine function, the cosine function is a function whose domain is the set of all real numbers and range is the set [–1, 1]
If we restrict the domain of cosine function to [0, π], then it becomes one-one and onto with range [–1, 1]
Actually , cosine functionFig 2.1 (ii) Fig 2.1 (iii)Fig 2.1 (i) INVERSE TRIGONOMETRIC FUNCTIONS restricted to an y of the intervals [– π, 0], [0,π], [π, 2π] etc., is bijective with range as [–1, 1]
We can, therefore, define the inverse of cosine function in each of these intervals
We denote the inverse of the cosine function by cos–1 (arc cosine function)
Thus, cos–1 is a function whose domain is [–1, 1] and range could be any of the intervals [– π, 0], [0, π], [π, 2π] etc
Corresponding to each such interval, we get a branch of the function cos–1
The branch with range [0, π] is called the principal value branch of the function cos–1
We write cos–1 : [–1, 1] → [0, π]
The graph of the function given by y = cos–1 x can be drawn in the same way as discussed about the graph of y = sin–1 x
The graphs of y = cos x and y = cos–1x are given in Fig 2.2 (i) and (ii)
Fig 2.2 (ii) Let us now discuss cosec–1x and sec–1x as follows: Since, cosec x = 1 sinx, the domain of the cosec function is the set {x : x ∈ R and x ≠ nπ, n ∈ Z} and the range is the set {y : y ∈ R, y ≥ 1 or y ≤ –1} i.e., the set R – (–1, 1)
It means that y = cosec x assumes all real values except –1 < y < 1 and is not defined for integral multiple of π
If we restrict the domain of cosec function to ,2 2π π -  – {0}, then it is one to one and onto with its range as the set R – (– 1, 1)
Actually , cosec function restricted to any of the intervals 3, { }2 2- π -π - -π  , ,2 2-π π     – {0}, 3, { }2 2π π - π   etc., is bijective and its range is the set of all real numbers R – (–1, 1).Fig 2.2 (i) Thus cosec–1 can be defined as a function whose domain is R – (–1, 1) and range could be any of the intervals - -  - -3 2 2π ππ, { } , -  -π π 2 , {}, 3, { }2 2π π - π  etc
The function corresponding to the range , {0}2 2-π π -  is called the principal value branch of cosec–1
We thus have principal branch as cosec–1 : R – (–1, 1) → , {0}2 2-π π -   The graphs of y = cosec x and y = cosec–1 x are given in Fig 2.3 (i), (ii)
Also, since sec x = 1 cosx, the domain of y = sec x is the set R – {x : x = (2n + 1) 2π, n ∈ Z} and range is the set R – (–1, 1)
It means that sec (secant function) assumes all real values except –1 < y < 1 and is not defined for odd multiples of 2π
If we restrict the domain of secant function to [0, π] – { 2π}, then it is one-one and onto withFig 2.3 (i) Fig 2.3 (ii) INVERSE TRIGONOMETRIC FUNCTIONS its range as the set R – (–1, 1)
Actually , secant function restricted to any of the intervals [– π, 0] – {2-π}, [0, ] –2π π  , [π, 2π] – {3 2π} etc., is bijective and its range is R – {–1, 1}
Thus sec–1 can be defined as a function whose domain is R– (–1, 1) and range could be any of the intervals [– π, 0] – {2-π}, [0, π] – {2π}, [π, 2π] – {3 2π} etc
Corresponding to each of t hese intervals , we get different branches of the function sec–1
The branch with range [0, π] – {2π} is called the principal value branch of the function sec–1
We thus have sec–1 : R – (–1,1) → [0, π] – {2π} The graphs of the functions y = sec x and y = sec-1 x are given in Fig 2.4 (i), (ii)
Finally , we now discuss tan–1 and cot–1 We know that the domain of the tan function (tangent function) is the set {x : x ∈ R and x ≠ (2n +1) 2π, n ∈ Z} and the range is R
It means that tan function is not defined for odd multiples of 2π
If we restrict the domain of tangent function toFig 2.4 (i) Fig 2.4 (ii) ,2 2-π π    , then it is one-one and onto with its range as R
Actually , tangent function restricted to any of the intervals 3,2 2- π -π    , ,2 2-π π    , 3,2 2π π     etc., is bijective and its range is R
Thus tan–1 can be defined as a function whose domain is R and range could be any of the intervals 3,2 2- π -π    , ,2 2-π π    , 3,2 2π π     and so on
These intervals give different branches of the function tan–1
The branch with range ,2 2-π π     is called the principal value branch of the function tan–1
We thus have tan–1 : R → ,2 2-π π     The graphs of the function y = tan x and y = tan–1x are given in Fig 2.5 (i), (ii)
Fig 2.5 (i) Fig 2.5 (ii) We know that domain of the cot function (cotangent function) is the set {x : x ∈ R and x ≠ nπ, n ∈ Z} and range is R
It means that cotangent function is not defined for integral multiples of π
If we restrict the domain of cotangent function to (0, π), then it is bijective with and its range as R
In fact, cotangent function restricted to any of the intervals (– π, 0), (0, π), (π, 2π) etc., is bijective and its range is R
Thus cot–1 can be defined as a function whose domain is the R and range as any of the INVERSE TRIGONOMETRIC FUNCTIONS intervals (– π, 0), (0, π), (π, 2π) etc
These intervals give different branches of the function co t–1
The function with range (0, π) is called the principal value branch of the function co t–1
We thus have cot–1 : R → (0, π) The graphs of y = cot x and y = cot–1x are given in Fig 2.6 (i), (ii)
Fig 2.6 (i) Fig 2.6 (ii) The following table gives the inverse trigonometric function (principal value branches) along with their domains and ranges
sin–1: [–1, 1] → ,2 2π π -   cos–1: [–1, 1] → [0, π] cosec–1: R – (–1,1) → ,2 2π π -  – {0} sec–1: R – (–1, 1) → [0, π] – { }2π tan–1: R → ,2 2-π π     cot–1: R → (0, π) ANote 1.sin–1x should not be confused with (sin x)–1
In fact (sin x)–1 = 1 sinx and similarly for other trigonometric functions
2.Whenever no branch of an inverse trigonometric functions is mentioned, we mean the principal value branch of that function
3.The value of an inverse trigonometric functions which lies in the range of principal branch is called the principal value of that inverse trigonometric functions
We now consider some examples:
Example 1
Find the principal value of sin–1 1 2
Solution
Let sin–1 1 2    = y
Then, sin y = 1 2
We know that the range of the principal value branch of sin–1 is -  π π 2 2, and sin4π    = 1 2
Therefore, principal value of sin–1 1 2     is 4π
Example 2

Solution
Let cot–1 1 3-     = y
Then, 1cot cot3 3y- π  = = -    = cot3π  π -   = 2cot3π    We know that the range of principal value branch of cot–1 is (0, π) and cot 2 3π    = 1 3-
Hence, principal value of cot–1 1 3-     is 2 3π EXERCISE 2.1 Find the principal values of the following: 1.sin–1 1 2 -  2.cos–1 3 2     3.cosec–1 (2) 4.tan–1 ( 3)- 5.cos–1 1 2 -  6.tan–1 (–1) INVERSE TRIGONOMETRIC FUNCTIONS 7.sec–1 2 3    8.cot–1 ( 3) 9.cos–1 1 2 -

tan–1 () sec 2-- - is equal to (A) π (B)3π- (C)3π(D)2 3π 2.3 Pr oper ties of Inverse Trigonometric Functions In this section, we shall prove some important properties of inverse trigonometric functions
It may be mentioned here that these results are valid within the principal value branches of the corresponding inverse trigonometric functions and wherever they are defined
Some results may not be valid for all values of the domains of inverse trigonometric functions
In fact, they will be valid only for some values of x for which inverse trigonometric functions are defined
We will not go into the details of these values of x in the domain as this discussion goes beyond the scope of this textbook
Let us recall that if y = sin–1x, then x = sin y and if x = sin y, then y = sin–1x
This is equivalent to sin (sin–1 x) = x, x ∈ [– 1, 1] and sin–1 (sin x) = x, x ∈ ,2 2-π π     For suitable values of domain similar results follow for remaining trigonometric functions
We now consider some examples

For suitable values of domain, we have ®y = sin–1 x ⇒ x = sin y ®x = sin y ⇒ y = sin–1 x ®sin (sin–1 x) = x ®sin–1 (sinx) = x INVERSE TRIGONOMETRIC FUNCTIONS Historical Note The study of trigonometry was first started in India
The ancient Indian Mathematicians, Aryabhata (476A.D.), Brahmagupta (598 A.D.), Bhaskara I (600 A.D.) and Bhaskara II (1 114 A.D.) got important results of trigonometry
All this knowledge went from India to Arabia and then from there to Europe
The Greeks had also started the study of trigonometry but their approach was so clumsy that when the Indian approach became known, it was immediately adopted throughout the world
In India, the predecessor of the modern trigonometric functions, known as the sine of an angle, and the introduction of the sine function represents one of the main contribution of the siddhantas (Sanskrit astronomical works) to mathematics
Bhaskara I (about 600 A.D.) gave formulae to find the values of sine functions for angles more than °
A sixteenth century Malayalam work Yuktibhasa contains a proof for the expansion of sin (A + B)
Exact expression for sines or cosines of °, °, °, °, etc., were given by Bhaskara II
The symbols sin–1 x, cos–1 x, etc., for arc sin x, arc cos x, etc., were suggested by the astronomer Sir John F .W
Hersehel (1813) The name of Thales (about 600 B.C.) is invariably associated with height and distance problems
He is credited with the determination of the height of a great pyramid in Egypt by measuring shadows of the pyramid and an auxiliary staff (or gnomon) of known height, and comparing the ratios: H Sh s= = tan (sun’ s altitude) Thales is also said to have calculated the distance of a ship at sea through the proportionality of sides of similar triangles
Problems on height and distance using the similarity property are also found in ancient Indian works
—vv— vThe essence of Mathematics lies in its freedom
— CANTOR 3.1 Introduction The knowledge of matrices is necessary in various branches of mathematics
Matrices are one of the most powerful tools in mathematics
This mathematical tool simplifies our work to a great extent when compared with other straight forward methods
The evolution of concept of matrices is the result of an attempt to obtain compact and simple methods of solving system of linear equations
Matrices are not only used as a representation of the coefficients in system of linear equations, but utility of matrices far exceeds that use
Matrix notation and operations are used in electronic spreadsheet programs for personal computer , which in turn is used in dif ferent areas of business and science like budgeting, sales projection, cost estimation, analysing the results of an experiment etc
Also, many physical operations such as magnification, rotation and reflection through a plane can be represented mathematically by matrices
Matrices are also used in cryptography
This mathematical tool is not only used in certain branches of sciences, but also in genetics, economics, sociology , modern psychology and industrial management
In this chapter , we shall find it interesting to become acquainted with the fundamentals of matrix and matrix algebra
3.2 Matrix Suppose we wish to express the information that Radha has notebooks
We may express it as [] with the understanding that the number inside [ ] is the number of notebooks that Radha has
Now , if we have to express that Radha has notebooks and 6 pens
We may express it as [ 6] with the understanding that first number inside [ ] is the number of notebooks while the other one is the number of pens possessed by Radha
Let us now suppose that we wish to express the information of possessionChapter 3 MATRICES MATRI CES of notebooks and pens by Radha and her two friends Fauzia and Simran which is as follows: Radha has notebooks and 6 pens, Fauzia has notebooks and 2 pens, Simran has notebooks and 5 pens
Now this could be arranged in the tabular form as follows: Notebooks Pens Radha 6 Fauzia 2 Simran 5 and this can be expressed as or Radha Fauzia Simran Notebooks Pens 6 2 5 which can be expressed as: In the first arrangement the entries in the first column represent the number of note books possessed by Radha, Fauzia and Simran, respectively and the entries in the second column represent the number of pens possessed by Radha, Fauzia and Simran, respectively
Similarly , in the second arrangement, the entries in the first row represent the number of notebooks possessed by Radha, Fauzia and Simran, respectively
The entries in the second row represent the number of pens possessed by Radha, Fauzia and Simran, respectively
An arrangement or display of the above kind is called a matrix
Formally , we define matrix as: Definition 1 A matrix is an ordered rectangular array of numbers or functions
The numbers or functions are called the elements or the entries of the matrix
We denote matrices by capital letters
The following are some examples of matrices: 5 – 2 A 0 5 3 6   =    , B 3.5 –1 2 i + -   =      , 3Ccos tan sin 2x x x x x += +   In the ab ove examples, the horizontal lines of elements are said to constitute, rows of the matrix and the vertical lines of elements are said to constitute, columns of the matrix
Thus A has 3 rows and 2 columns, B has 3 rows and 3 columns while C has 2 rows and 3 columns
3.2.1 Order of a matrix A matrix having m rows and n columns is called a matrix of order m * n or simply m * n matrix (read as an m by n matrix)
So referring to the above examples of matrices, we have A as 3 * 2 matrix, B as 3 * 3 matrix and C as 2 * 3 matrix
We observe that A has 3 * 2 = 6 elements, B and C have 9 and 6 elements, respectively
In general, an m * n matrix has the following rectangular array: orA = [ aij]m * n, 1≤ i ≤ m, 1≤ j ≤ n i, j ∈ N Thus the ith row consists of the elements ai1, ai2, ai3,..., ain, while the jth column consists of the elements a1j, a2j, a3j,..., amj, In general aij, is an element lying in the ith row and jth column
We can also call it as the ( i, j)th element of A
The number of elements in an m * n matrix will be equal to mn
MATRI CES ANote In this chapter 1.We shall follow the notation, namely A = [aij]m * n to indicate that A is a matrix of order m * n
2.We shall consider only those matrices whose elements are real numbers or functions taking real values
We can also represent any point ( x, y) in a plane by a matrix (column or row) as x y     (or [ x, y])
For example point P(0, 1) as a matrix representation may be given as 0P1 =   or [0 1]
Observe that in this way we can also express the vertices of a closed rectilinear figure in the form of a matrix
For example, consider a quadrilateral ABCD with vertices A (1, 0), B (3, 2), C (1, 3), D (–1, 2)
Now , quadrilateral ABCD in the matrix form, can be represented as 2 4A B C D 1 3 1 1X0 2 3 2*-  =  or 4 2A 1 0 B 3 2YC 1 3 D 1 2*     =   -  Thus, matrices can be used as representation of vertices of geometrical figures in a plane
Now , let us consider some examples
Example 1
Consider the following information regarding the number of men and women workers in three factories I, II and III Men workers Women workers I II III Represent the above information in the form of a 3 * 2 matrix
What does the entry in the third row and second column represent?
Solution
The information is represented in the form of a 3 * 2 matrix as follows: A    =     The ent ry in the third row and second column represents the number of women workers in factory III
Example 2
If a matrix has 8 elements, what are the possible orders it can have?
Solution
We know that if a matrix is of order m * n, it has mn elements
Thus, to find all possible orders of a matrix with 8 elements, we will find all ordered pairs of natural numbers, whose product is 8
Thus, all possible ordered pairs are (1, 8), (8, 1), (4, 2), (2, 4) Hence, possible orders are 1 * 8, 8 *1, 4 * 2, 2 * 4
Example 3
Construct a 3 * 2 matrix whose elements are given by 1| 3 |2ija i j= -
Solution
In general a 3 * 2 matrix is given by Aa a a a a a   =
Now1| 3 |2ija i j= - , i = 1, 2, 3 and j = 1, 2
Therefore 111|1 3 1| a= - * =121 5|1 3 2 |2 2a= - * = 211 1| 2 3 1|2 2a= - * =221| 2 3 2 | a= - * = 311| 3 3 1| a= - * =321 3| 3 3 2 |2 2a= - * = Hence the required matrix is given by A 2230 2     =
MATRI CES 3.3 Types of Matrices In this section, we shall discuss different types of matrices
(i)Column matrix A matrix is said to be a column matrix if it has only one column
For example, 0 3 A 1 1/ 2       = -     is a column matrix of order 4 * 1
In general, A = [aij]m * 1 is a column matrix of order m * 1
(ii) Row matrix A matrix is said to be a row matrix if it has only one row
For example, 1 B 5 2 * = -   is a row matrix
In general, B = [ bij]1 * n is a row matrix of order 1 * n
(iii) Square matrix A matrix in which the number of rows are equal to the number of columns, is said to be a squar e matrix
Thus an m * n matrix is said to be a square matrix if m = n and is known as a square matrix of order ‘ n’
For example 3 1 0 3A 3 2 4 3 1-      =    -   is a square matrix of order 3
In general, A = [aij]m * m is a square matrix of order m
ANote If A = [ aij] is a square matrix of order n, then elements (entries) a, a, ..., ann are said to constitute the diagonal , of the matrix A
Thus, if 1 3 1 A 2 4 1 3 5 6-   = -
Then the elements of the diagonal of A are 1, 4, 6
(iv) Diagonal matrix A square matrix B = [ bij]m * m is said to be a diagonal matrix if all its non diagonal elements are zero, that is a matrix B = [ bij]m * m is said to be a diagonal matrix if bij = 0, when i ≠ j
For example, A = [4], 1 0B0 2- =  , 1.1 0 0 C 0 2 0 0 0 3-   =    , are diagonal matrices of order 1, 2, 3, respectively
(v) Scalar matrix A diagonal matrix is said to be a scalar matrix if its diagonal elements are equal, that is, a square matrix B = [ bij]n * n is said to be a scalar matrix if bij = 0, when i ≠ j bij = k, when i = j, for some constant k
For example A = [3], 1 0B0 1- = -  , 3 0 0 C 0 3 0 0 0 3    =      are scalar matrices of order 1, 2 and 3, respectively
(vi) Identity matrix A square matrix in which elements in the diagonal are all 1 and rest are all zero is called an identity matrix
In other words, the square matrix A = [ aij]n * n is an identity matrix, if 1 if 0 ifiji jai j= =≠
We denote the identity matrix of order n by In
When order is clear from the context, we simply write it as I
For example [1], 1 0 0 1    , 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1         are identity matrices of order 1, 2 and 3, respectively
Observe that a scalar matrix is an identity matrix when k = 1
But every identity matrix is clearly a scalar matrix
MATRI CES (vii) Zero matrix A matrix is said to be zero matrix or null matrix if all its elements are zero
For example, [0], 0 0 0 0    , 0 0 0 0 0 0    , [0, 0] are all zero matrices
We denote zero matrix by O
Its order will be clear from the context
3.3.1 Equality of matrices Definition 2 Two matrices A = [aij] and B = [ bij] are said to be equal if (i)they are of the same order (ii) each element of A is equal to the corresponding element of B, that is aij = bij for all i and j
For example, 2 3 2 3and0 1 0 1           are equal matrices but 3 2 2 3and0 1 0 1           are not equal matrices
Symbolically , if two matrices A and B are equal, we write A = B
If 1.5 0 2 6 3 2x y z a b c-       =          , then x = – 1.5, y = 0, z = 2, a = 6, b = 3, c = 2
Example 4
If 3 4 2 7 0 6 3 2 6 1 0 6 3 2 2 3 0 2 4 0x z y y a c b b+ + - -       - - = - - +       - - + -    Find the values of a, b, c, x, y and z
Solution
As the given matrices are equal, therefore, their corresponding elements must be equal
Comparing the corresponding elements, we get x + 3= 0, z + 4 = 6, 2y – 7= 3y – 2 a – 1 = – 3, 0 =2c + 2 b – 3 = 2b + 4, Simplifying, we get a = – 2, b = – 7, c = – 1, x = – 3, y = –5, z = 2
Example 5
Find the values of a, b, c, and d from the following equation: 2 2 4 3 5 4 3 a b a b c d c d+ - -   =    - +
Solution
By equality of two matrices, equating the corresponding elements, we get 2a + b =4 5c – d = a – 2b =– 3 4c + 3d = Solving these equations, we get a = 1, b =2, c = 3 and d = 4 EXERCISE 3.1 1.In the matrix 2 5 7 5A 2 122 3 1 5  -    = -    -  , write: (i)The order of the matrix, (ii)The number of elements, (iii)Write the elements a, a, a, a, a

The number of all possible matrices of order 3 * 3 with each entry 0 or 1 is: (A) (B) (C) (D) 512 3.4 Operations on Matrices In this section, we shall introduce certain operations on matrices, namely , addition of matrices, multiplication of a matrix by a scalar , difference and multiplication of matrices
3.4.1 Addition of matrices Suppose Fatima has two factories at places A and B
Each factory produces sport shoes for boys and girls in three different price categories labelled 1, 2 and 3
The quantities produced by each factory are represented as matrices given below: Suppose Fatima wants to know the total production of sport shoes in each price category
Then the total production In category 1 : for boys ( + ), for girls ( + ) In category 2 : for boys ( + ), for girls ( + ) In category 3 : for boys ( + ), for girls ( + ) This can be represented in the matrix form as + +   + +   + +
This new matrix is the sum of the above two matrices
We observe that the sum of two matrices is a matrix obtained by adding the corresponding elements of the given matrices
Furthermore, the two matrices have to be of the same order
Thus, if Aa a a a a a =   is a 2 * 3 matrix and Bb b b b b b =   is another 2*3 matrix
Then, we define A + Ba b a b a b a b a b a b+ + + = + + +
In general, if A = [aij] and B = [ bij] are two matrices of the same order , say m * n
Then, the sum of the two matrices A and B is defined as a matrix C = [ cij]m * n, where cij = aij + bij, for all possible values of i and j
Example 6
Given 3 1 1A 2 3 0  -=    and 2 5 1 B    = -  , find A + B Since A, B are of the same order 2 * 3
Therefore, addition of A and B is defined and is given by 2 3 1 5 1 1 2 3 1 5 0 A + B 1 2 3 3 0 0 2   + + - + +    = =   - + +       ANote 1.We emphasise that if A and B are not of the same order , then A + B is not defined
For example if 2 3A1 0 =  , 1 2 3B ,1 0 1 =   then A + B is not defined
2.We may observe that addition of matrices is an example of binary operation on the set of matrices of the same order
3.4.2 Multiplication of a matrix by a scalar Now sup pose that Fatima has doubled the production at a factory A in all categories (refer to 3.4.1)
MATRI CES Previously quantities (in standard units) produced by factor y A were Revised quantities produced by factory A are as given below: Boys Girls 2 2 601 2 2 2 2 * *   * *   * *  This can be represented in the matrix form as 160 120 150 130 180 170
We observe that the new matrix is obtained by multiplying each element of the previous matrix by 2
In general, we may define multiplication of a matrix by a scalar as follows: if A = [aij]m * n is a matrix and k is a scalar , then kA is another matrix which is obtained by multiplying each element of A by the scalar k
In other words, kA = k[aij]m * n = [k(aij)]m * n, that is, ( i, j)th element of kA is kaij for all possible values of i and j
For example, if A =3 1 1.5 5 7 3 2 0 5   -     , then 3A =3 1 1.5 9 3 4.5 3 5 7 3 3 5 9 2 0 5 6 0        - = -            Negative of a matrix The negative of a matrix is denoted by –A
We define –A = ( –1) A
For example, let A =3 1 5x   - , then – A is given by – A =(– 1)3 1 3 1A ( 1)5 5x x- -    = - =   - -    Difference of matrices If A = [aij], B = [ bij] are two matrices of the same order , say m * n, then dif ference A – B is defined as a matrix D = [ dij], where dij = aij – bij, for all value of i and j
In other words, D = A – B = A + (–1) B, that is sum of the matrix A and the matrix – B
Example 7
If 1 2 3 3 1 3A and B2 3 1 1 0 2-    = =   -    , then find 2A – B
Solution
We have 2A – B = 2 3 2 3 1 3 1 0 2  -- -   =2 4 6 3 1 3 4 6 2 1 0 2- -    +    -     =2 3 4 1 6 3 1 5 3 4 1 6 0 2 2 5 6 0- + - -   =   + + -    3.4.3 Properties of matrix addition The addition of matrices satisfy the following properties: (i)Commutative Law If A = [aij], B = [ bij] are matrices of the same order , say m * n, then A + B = B + A
Now A + B = [aij] + [ bij] = [ aij + bij] =[bij + aij] (addition of numbers is commutative) =([bij] + [aij]) = B + A (ii) Associative Law For any three matrices A = [aij], B = [ bij], C = [ cij] of the same order , say m * n, (A + B) + C = A + (B + C)
Now (A + B) + C = ([aij] + [ bij]) + [ cij] =[aij + bij] + [ cij] = [( aij + bij) + cij] =[aij + (bij + cij)] (Why?) =[aij] + [( bij + cij)] = [ aij] + ([ bij] + [cij]) = A + (B + C) MATRI CES (iii) Existence of additive identity Let A = [aij] be an m * n matrix and O be an m * n zero matrix, then A + O = O + A = A
In other words, O is the additive identity for matrix addition
(iv) The existence of additive inverse Let A = [ aij]m * n be any matrix, then we have another matrix as – A = [– aij]m * n such that A + (– A) = (– A) + A= O
So – A is the additive inverse of A or negative of A
3.4.4 Properties of scalar multiplication of a matrix If A = [aij] and B = [ bij] be two matrices of the same order , say m * n, and k and l are scalars, then (i)k(A +B) = k A + kB, (ii) ( k + l)A = k A + l A (ii) k (A + B) = k ([aij] + [ bij]) = k [aij + bij] = [ k (aij + bij)] = [( k aij) + ( k bij)] = [k aij] + [ k bij] = k [aij] + k [bij] = kA + kB (iii) (k + l) A = (k + l) [aij] = [(k + l) aij] + [k aij] + [l aij] = k [aij] + l [aij] = k A + l A

Solution
We have 2A + 3X = 5B or 2A + 3X – 2A = 5B – 2A or 2A – 2A + 3X = 5B – 2A (Matrix addition is commutative) or O + 3X = 5B – 2A (– 2A is the additive inverse of 2A) or 3X = 5B – 2A (O is the additive identity) or X = 1 3 (5B – 2A) or2 2 8 0 1X 5 4 2 2 4 235 1 3 6  -         = - -        -     = 0 120 8 4325 5 6   - -         + -        - - -     = 0 120 8 4325 6 5 - - +   - +   - - -  = 6 112 14331 7- -       - -  = 1443 7 3 3-  -         - -

Example 1
1 Two farmers Ramkishan and Gurcharan Singh cultivates only three varieties of rice namely Basmati, Permal and Naura
The sale (in Rupees) of these varieties of rice by both the farmers in the month of September and October are given by the following matrices A and B
(i)Find the combined sales in September and October for each farmer in each variety
(ii) Find the decrease in sales from September to October
(iii) If both farmers receive 2% profit on gross sales, compute the profit for each farmer and for each variety sold in October
Solution
(i)Combined sales in September and October for each farmer in each variety is given by (ii) Change in sales from September to October is given by (iii) 2% of B = 2B100*= 0
* B =0
= Thus, in October R amkishan receives ` 100, ` 200 and ` 120 as profit in the sale of each variety of rice, respectively , and Grucharan Singh receives profit of ` 400, ` 200 and ` 200 in t he sale of each variety of rice, respectively
3.4.5 Multiplication of matrices Suppose Meera and Nadeem are two friends
Meera wants to buy 2 pens and 5 story books, while Nadeem needs 8 pens and story books
They both go to a shop to enquire about the rates which are quoted as follows: Pen – ` 5 each, story book – ` each
How much money does each need to spend? Clearly , Meera needs ` (5 * 2 + * 5) that is ` 260, while Nadeem needs (8 * 5 + * ) `, that is ` 540
In terms of matrix representation, w e can write the above information as follows: Requirements Prices per piece (in Rupees) Money needed (in Rupees) 2 5 8     5     5 2 5 260 8 5 540* + *   =   * + *    Suppose that they enquire about the rates from another shop, quoted as follows: pen – ` 4 each, story book – ` each
Now , the money required by Meera and Nadeem to make purchases will be respectively ` (4 * 2 + * 5) = ` 208 and ` (8 * 4 + * ) = ` 432 MATRI CES Again, the above information can be represented as follows: Requirements Prices per piece (in Rupees) Money needed (in Rupees) 2 5 8     4     4 2 5 208 8 4 432* + *   =    * + *    Now , the information in both the cases can be combined and expressed in terms of matrices as follows: Requirements Prices per piece (in Rupees) Money needed (in Rupees) 2 5 8     5 4     5 2 5 4 2 5 8 5 8 4 * + * * + *   * + * * + *  = 260 208 540 432     The above is an example of multiplication of matrices
We observe that, for multiplication of two matrices A and B, the number of columns in A should be equal to the number of rows in B
Furthermore for getting the elements of the product matrix, we take rows of A and columns of B, multiply them element-wise and take the sum
Formally , we define multiplication of matrices as follows: The product of two matrices A and B is defined if the number of columns of A is equal to the number of rows of B
Let A = [aij] be an m * n matrix and B = [ bjk] be an n * p matrix
Then the product of the matrices A and B is the matrix C of order m * p
To get the ( i, k)th element cik of the matrix C, we take the ith row of A and kth column of B, multiply them elementwise and take the sum of all these products
In other words , if A = [aij]m * n, B = [ bjk]n * p, then the ith row of A is [ai1 ai2 ..
ain] and the kth column of B is 1 2
.k k nkb b b             , then cik = ai1 b1k + ai2 b2k + ai3 b3k + ..
+ ain bnk = 1n ij jk ja b =∑
The matrix C = [ cik]m * p is the product of A and B
For example, if 1 1 2C0 3 4- =   and 2 7 1 D 1 5 4   = -    -   , then the product CD is defined and is given by 2 1 2CD 1 3 4 -   = -      -
This is a 2 * 2 matrix in which each entry is the sum of the products across some row of C with the corresponding entries down some column of D
These four computations are Thus 2CD -  = -   Example Find AB, if 6 9 2 6 0A and B2 3 7 9 8   = =
Solution
The matrix A has 2 columns which is equal to the number of rows of B
Hence AB is defined
Now 6(2) 9(7) 6(6) 9(9) 6(0) 9(8)AB2(2) 3(7) 2(6) 3(9) 2(0) 3(8)+ + +  = + + +   = 0 4 0 + + +   + + +  = 117      MATRI CES Remark If AB is defined, then BA need not be defined
In the above example, AB is defined but BA is not defined because B has 3 column while A has only 2 (and not 3) rows
If A, B are, respectively m * n, k * l matrices, then both AB and BA are defined if and only if n = k and l = m
In particular , if both A and B are square matrices of the same order , then both AB and BA are defined
Non-commutativity of multiplication of matrices Now , we shall see by an example that even if AB and BA are both defined, it is not necessary that AB = BA
Example If 2 2 3A and B 4 2 1 -    = =    -   , then find AB, BA
Show that AB ≠ BA
Solution
Since A is a 2 * 3 matrix and B is 3 * 2 matrix
Hence AB and BA are both defined and are matrices of order 2 * 2 and 3 * 3, respectively
Note that 2 2 3AB 4 2 1 -   =    -    = 2 8 6 3 3 0 4 8 8 5 3- + - + -   =    - + + - + +    and2 3 2 4 6 6 151 2 3BA 4 5 4 8 254 2 1 2 4 4 2 6 5- - + +    -     = = - - + +       -     - - + +     2 2 2 2 -   = -   - -  Clearly AB ≠ BA In the above example both AB and BA are of dif ferent order and so AB ≠ BA
But one may think that perhaps AB and BA could be the same if they were of the same order
But it is not so, here we give an example to show that even if AB and BA are of same order they may not be same
Example If 1 0A0 1 = -   and 0 1B1 0 =  , then 0 1AB1 0 = -
and0 1BA1 0- =
Clearly AB ≠ BA
Thus matrix multiplication is not commutative
ANote This does not mean that AB ≠ BA for every pair of matrices A, B for which AB and BA, are defined
For instance, If 1 0 3 0A , B0 2 0 4   = =      , then AB = BA = 3 0 0 8     Observe that multiplication of diagonal matrices of same order will be commutative
Zero matrix as the product of two non zero matrices We know that, for real numbers a, b if ab = 0, then either a = 0 or b = 0
This need not be true for matrices, we will observe this through an example
Example Find AB, if 0 1A0 2- =   and 3 5B0 0 =
Solution
We have 0 1 3 5 0 0AB0 2 0 0 0 0-     = =
Thus, if the product of two matrices is a zero matrix, it is not necessary that one of the matrices is a zero matrix
3.4.6 Properties of multiplication of matrices The multiplication of matrices possesses the following properties, which we state without proof
1.The associative law For any three matrices A, B and C
We have (AB) C = A (BC), whenever both sides of the equality are defined
2.The distributive law For three matrices A, B and C
(i)A (B+C) = AB + AC (ii)(A+B) C = AC + BC, whenever both sides of equality are defined
3.The existence of multiplicative identity For every square matrix A, there exist an identi ty matrix of same order such that IA = AI = A
Now , we shall ver ify these properties by examples
Example If 1 1 1 1 2 3 4A 2 0 3 , B 0 2 and C2 0 2 1 2 1 4-    -      = = =      -     - -   , find A(BC), (AB)C and show that (AB)C = A(BC)

Transpose of a Matrix In this section, we shall learn about transpose of a matrix and special types of matrices such as symmetric and skew symmetric matrices
Definition 3 If A = [aij] be an m * n matrix, then the matrix obtained by interchanging the rows and columns of A is called the transpose of A
Transpose of the matrix A is denoted by A′ or (AT)
In other words, if A = [aij]m * n, then A′ = [aji]n * m
For example, if 2 3 3 5 3 3 0 A 3 1 , then A 1 5 5* *      = ′ =  -      -     3.5.1 Properties of transpose of the matrices We now state the following properties of transpose of matrices without proof
These may be verified by taking suitable examples
For any matrices A and B of suitable orders, we have (i)(A′)′ = A, (ii) (kA)′ = kA′ (where k is any constant) (iii) (A + B) ′ = A′ + B′ (iv) (A B)′ = B′ A′ Example If 2 1 2 3 3 2A and B1 2 4 4 2 0  - = =      , verify that (i)(A′)′ = A, (ii) (A + B) ′ = A′ + B′, (iii) (kB)′ = kB′, where k is any constant
Solution
(i)We have A = ( ) 3 3 2 3 3 2A 3 2 A A 4 2 0 4 2 0       ′ ′ ′ ⇒ = ⇒ = =              Thus (A′)′ =A (ii) We have A = 3 3 2, 4 2 0      B =2 1 2 5 3 1 4A B1 2 4 5 4 4  -   -⇒ + =        Therefore (A + B) ′ =5 5 3 1 4 4 4   -     Now A′ = 2 1 3 2 , B 1 2 , 2 0 2 4      ′= -           So A′ + B′ =5 5 3 1 4 4 4   -     Thus (A + B) ′ =A′ + B′ (iii) We have kB =k2 1 2 2 2 1 2 4 2 4k k k k k k- -    =       Then (kB)′ =2 2 1 2 1 2 B 2 4 2 4k k k k k k k k       ′ - = - =           Thus (kB)′ =kB′ MATRI CES Example If [ ]2 A 4 , B 1 3 6 5-   = = -    , verify that (AB) ′ = B′A′
Solution
We have A =[ ]2 4 , B 1 3 6 5-   = -     then AB = [ ]2 4 1 3 6 5-   -     = 2 6 4 5 - -   -    -   Now A′ =[–2 4 5] , 1 B 3 6   ′=   -  B′A′ = [ ]1 2 4 5 3 2 4 5 6 (AB) 6 -        ′ - = - =       - - -    Clearly (AB) ′ =B′A′ 3.6 Symmetric and Skew Symmetric Matrices Definition 4 A square matrix A = [aij] is said to be symmetric if A′ = A, that is, [aij] = [aji] for all possible values of i and j
For example 3 2 3 A 2 1.5 1 3 1 1   = - -    -   is a symmetric matrix as A′ = A Definition 5 A square matrix A = [aij] is said to be skew symmetric matrix if A′ = – A, that is aji = – aij for all possible values of i and j
Now , if we put i = j, we have aii = – aii
Therefore 2 aii = 0 or aii = 0 for all i’s
This means that all the diagonal elements of a skew symmetric matrix are zero
For example, the matrix 0 B 0 0e f e g f g   = -   - -  is a skew symmetric matrix as B ′= –B Now , we are going to prove some results of symmetric and skew-symmetric matrices
Theorem 1 For any square matrix A with real number entries, A + A ′ is a symmetric matrix and A – A′ is a skew symmetric matrix
Proof Let B = A + A′, then B′ =(A + A′)′ =A′ + (A ′)′ (as (A + B) ′ = A′ + B′) =A′ + A (as (A ′)′ = A) =A + A′ (as A + B = B + A) =B Therefore B = A + A′ is a symmetric matrix Now let C = A – A ′ C′ =(A – A ′)′ = A ′ – (A ′)′ (Why?) =A′ – A (Why?) =– (A – A ′) = – C Therefore C = A – A ′ is a s kew symmetric matrix
Theorem 2 Any square matrix can be expressed as the sum of a symmetric and a skew symmetric matrix
Proof Let A be a square matrix, then we can write 1 1A (A A ) (A A )2 2′ ′ = + + - From the Theorem 1, we know that (A + A′) is a symmetric matrix and (A – A′) is a skew symmetric matrix
Since for any matrix A, (kA)′ = kA′, it follows that 1(A A )2′+ MATRI CES is symmetric matrix and 1(A A )2′- is skew symmetric matrix
Thus, any square matrix can be expressed as the sum of a symmetric and a skew symmetric matrix
Example Express the matrix 2 2 4 B 1 3 4 1 2 3- -    = -    - -   as the sum of a symmetric and a skew symmetric matrix
Solution
Here B′ =2 1 1 2 3 2 4 4 3-    - -   - -  Let P =4 3 3 1 1(B + B ) 3 6 2 6- -    ′= -   - -  = 3 322 2 - -      -     -  -  , Now P′ =3 322 2 - -      -     -  -  = P Thus P =1(B + B )2′ is a symmetric matrix
Also, let Q =1 502 1 5 1 1 1(B – B ) 1 0 6 0 2 6 053 - -    - -       ′= =     -      -   Then Q′ =1 502 3 3 Q2      - - = -   -     Thus Q =1(B – B )2′ is a skew symmetric matrix
Now3 3 1 2 2 2 4 3 1P+Q 3 1 0 3 1 3 4 B2 2 3 3 2- - - -        - -      -      = + = - =        - -      -    - -       Thus, B is represented as the sum of a symmetric and a skew symmetric matrix

In that case A is said to be invertible
For example, let A =2 3 1 2    and B = 2 3 1 2-   - be two matrices
Now AB =2 3 2 3 1 2 1 2-      -   =4 3 6 6 1 0I2 2 3 4 0 1- - +   = =    - - +    Also BA =1 0I0 1 =
Thus B is the inverse of A, in other words B = A– 1 and A is inverse of B, i.e., A = B–1 MATRI CES ANote 1.A rectangular matrix does not possess inverse matrix, since for products BA and AB to be defined and to be equal, it is necessary that matrices A and B should be square matrices of the same order
2.If B is the inverse of A, then A is also the inverse of B
Theorem 3 (Uniqueness of inverse) Inverse of a square matrix, if it exists, is unique
Proof Let A = [aij] be a square matrix of order m
If possible, let B and C be two inverses of A
We shall show that B = C
Since B is the inverse of A AB = BA = I ..
(1) Since C is also the inverse of A AC = CA = I ..
(2) Thus B =BI = B (A C) = (BA) C = IC = C Theor em 4 If A and B are invertible matrices of the same order , then (AB)–1 = B–1 A–1
Proof From the definition of inverse of a matrix, we have (AB) (AB)–1 =1 or A–1 (AB) (AB)–1 =A–1I (Pre multiplying both sides by A–1) or (A–1A) B (AB)–1 =A–1(Since A–1 I = A–1) or IB (AB)–1 =A–1 or B (AB)–1 =A–1 or B–1 B (AB)–1 =B–1 A–1 or I (AB)–1 =B–1 A–1 Hence (AB)–1 =B–1 A–1 1

3 If cos sinAsin cosθ θ  = - θ θ , then prove that cos sinAsin cosn n n n nθ θ  = - θ θ , n ∈ N
Solution
We shall prove the result by using principle of mathematical induction
We have P(n) : If cos sinAsin cosθ θ  = - θ θ , then cos sinAsin cosn n n n nθ θ  = - θ θ , n ∈ N P(1) : cos sinAsin cosθ θ  = - θ θ , so 1 cos sinAsin cosθ θ  = - θ θ  Therefore, the result is true for n = 1
Let the result be true for n = k
So P(k) : cos sinAsin cosθ θ  = - θ θ , then cos sinAsin cosk k k k kθ θ  = - θ θ  Now , we prove that the result holds for n = k +1 Now Ak + 1 =cos sin cos sinA Asin cos sin cosk k k k kθ θ θ θ    ⋅ =   - θ θ - θ θ    =cos cos – sin sin cos sin sin cos sin cos cos sin sin sin cos cosk k k k k k k kθ θ θ θ θ θ + θ θ    - θ θ + θ θ - θ θ + θ θ  =cos( ) sin ( ) cos( 1) sin ( 1) sin ( ) cos( ) sin ( 1) cos( 1)k k k k k k k kθ + θ θ + θ + θ + θ    =   - θ + θ θ + θ - + θ + θ    Therefore, the result is true for n = k + 1

Example If A and B are symmetric matrices of the same order , then show that AB is symmetric if and only if A and B commute, that is AB = BA
Solution
Since A and B are both symmetric matrices, therefore A′ = A and B ′ = B
MATRI CES Let AB be symmetric, then (AB) ′ =AB But (AB) ′ =B′A′= BA (Why?) Therefore BA = AB Conversely , if AB = BA, then we shall show that AB is symmetric
Now (AB) ′ =B′A′ =B A (as A and B are symmetric) =AB Hence AB is symmetric

STEINMETZ 4.1 Introduction In the previous chapter , we have studied about matrices and algebra of matrices
We have also learnt that a system of algebraic equations can be expressed in the form of matrices
This means, a system of linear equations like a1 x + b1 y =c1 a2 x + b2 y =c2 can be represented as 1 1 1 2 2 2a b c x a b c y     =
Now , this system of equations has a unique solution or not, is determined by the number a1 b2 – a2 b1
(Recall that if 1 1 2 2a b a b≠ or, a1 b2 – a2 b1 ≠ 0, then the system of linear equations has a unique solution)
The number a1 b2 – a2 b1 which determines uniqueness of solution is associated with the matrix 1 1 2 2Aa b a b =   and is called the determinant of A or det A
Determinants have wide applications in Engineering, Science, Economics, Social Science, etc
In this chapter, we shall study determinants up to order three only with real entries
Also, we will study various properties of determinants, minors, cofactors and applications of determinants in finding the area of a triangle, adjoint and inverse of a square matrix, consistency and inconsistency of system of linear equations and solution of linear equations in two or three variables using inverse of a matrix
4.2 Determinant To every square matrix A = [aij] of order n, we can associate a number (real or complex) called determinant of the square matrix A, where aij = (i, j)th element of A.Chapter 4 DETERMINANTS P.S
Laplace (1749-1827) DETERMINANTS This may be thought of as a function which associates each square matrix with a unique number (real or complex)
If M is the set of square matrices, K is the set of numbers (real or complex) and f : M → K is defined by f(A) = k, where A ∈ M and k ∈ K, then f(A) is called the determinant of A
It is also denoted by |A| or det A or ∆
If A = a b c d    , then determinant of A is written as |A| = a b c d = det (A) Remarks (i)For matrix A, |A| is read as determinant of A and not modulus of A
(ii) Only square matrices have determinants
4.2.1 Determinant of a matrix of order one Let A = [a] be the matrix of order 1, then determinant of A is defined to be equal to a 4.2.2 Determinant of a matrix of order two Let A = a a a a     be a matrix of order 2 * 2, then the determinant of A is defined as: det (A) = |A| = ∆ = = aa – aa
Example 1
Evaluate 2 4 –1 2
Solution
We have 2 4 –1 2 = 2(2) – 4(–1) = 4 + 4 = 8
Example 2
Evaluate 1 – 1x x x x+
Solution
We have 1 – 1x x x x+ = x (x) – (x + 1) ( x – 1) = x2 – (x2 – 1) = x2 – x2 + 1 = 1 4.2.3 Determinant of a matrix of order 3 * 3 Determinant of a matrix of order three can be determined by expressing it in terms of second order determinants
This is known as expansion of a determinant along a row (or a column)
There are six ways of expanding a determinant of order 3 corresponding to each of three rows (R1, R2 and R3) and three columns (C1, C2 and C3) giving the same value as shown below
Consider the determinant of square matrix A = [ aij]3 * 3 i.e., | A | = a a a a a a a a a Expansion along first Row (R1) Step 1 Multiply first element a of R1 by (–1)(1 + 1) [(–1)sum of suf fixes in a] and with the second order determinant obtained by deleting the elements of first row (R1) and first column (C1) of | A | as a lies in R1 and C1, i.e., (–1)1 + 1 a a a a a Step 2 Multiply 2nd element a of R1 by (–1)1 + 2 [(–1)sum of suf fixes in a] and the second order determinant obtained by deleting elements of first row (R1) and 2nd column (C2) of | A | as a lies in R1 and C2, i.e., (–1)1 + 2a a a a a Step 3 Multiply third element a of R1 by (–1)1 + 3 [(–1)sum of suf fixes in a] and the second order determinant obtained by deleting elements of first row (R1) and third column (C3) of | A | as a lies in R1 and C3, i.e., (–1)1 + 3a a a a a Step 4 Now the expansion of determinant of A, that is, | A | written as sum of all three terms obtained in steps 1, 2 and 3 above is given by det A =|A| = (–1)1 + 1 a 1 2 (–1)a a a aaa a a a++ + 1 3 (–1)a aaa a+ or |A| =a (a a – a a) – a (a a – a a) + a (a a – a a) DETERMINANTS =a a a – a a a – a a a + a a a + a a a – a a a..
(1) ANote We shall apply all four steps together
Expansion along second row (R2) | A | = a a a a a a a a a Expanding along R2, we get | A | = 2 1 2 2 (–1) (–1)a a a aa aa a a a+ ++ 2 3 (–1)a aaa a++ =– a (a a – a a) + a (a a – a a) – a (a a – a a) | A | =– a a a + a a a + a a a – a a a – a a a + a a a =a a a – a a a – a a a + a a a + a a a – a a a..
(2) Expansion along first Column (C1) | A | = 3311 a a aa a a a a a By expanding along C1, we get | A | = 1 1 2 1 (–1) ( 1)a a a aa aa a a a+ ++ - + 3 1 (–1)a aaa a+ =a (a a – a a) – a (a a – a a) + a (a a – a a) | A | =a a a – a a a – a a a + a a a + a a a – a a a =a a a – a a a – a a a + a a a + a a a – a a a..
(3) Clearly , values of |A| in (1), (2) and (3) are equal
It is left as an exercise to the reader to verify that the values of |A| by expanding along R3, C2 and C3 are equal to the value of |A| obtained in (1), (2) or (3)
Hence, expanding a determinant along any row or column gives same value
Remarks (i)For easier calculations, we shall expand the determinant along that row or column which contains maximum number of zeros
(ii) While expanding, instead of multiplying by (–1)i + j, we can multiply by +1 or –1 according as ( i + j) is even or odd
(iii) Let A = 2 2 4 0     and B = 1 1 2 0
Then, it is easy to verify that A = 2B
Also |A| = 0 – 8 = – 8 and |B| = 0 – 2 = – 2
Observe that, |A| = 4(– 2) = |B| or |A| = 2n|B|, where n = 2 is the order of square matrices A and B
In general, if A = kB where A and B are square matrices of order n, then | A| = kn | B |, where n = 1, 2, 3
Example 3
Evaluate the determinant ∆ = 1 2 4 –1 3 0 4 1 0
Solution
Note that in the third column, two entries are zero
So expanding along third column (C3), we get ∆ =–1 3 1 2 1 – 0 1 4 1 –1 3+ =4 (–1 – ) – 0 + 0 = –
Example 4
Evaluate ∆ = 0 sin – cos –sin 0 sin cos –sin 0α α α β α β

Expanding along R1, we get ∆ =0 sin – sin sin – sin – sin – cos– sin 0 cos 0 cos – sinβ α β αα αβ α α β =0 – sin α (0 – sin β cos α) – cos α (sin α sin β – 0) =sin α sin β cos α – cos α sin α sin β = 0

Now this expression can be written in the form of a determinant as ∆ =1 1 2 2 3 1121x y x y x y..
(1) Remarks (i)Since area is a positive quantity , we always take the absolute value of the determinant in (1)
(ii) If area is given, use both positive and negative values of the determinant for calculation
(iii) The area of the triangle formed by three collinear points is zero
Example 6

Example 7
Find the equation of the line joining A(1, 3) and B (0, 0) using determinants and find k if D( k, 0) is a point such that area of triangle ABD is 3sq units
Solution
Let P (x, y) be any point on AB
Then, area of triangle ABP is zero (Why?)
So 0 0 1 3 121 x y =0 This gives ( )132y – x =0 or y = 3x, which is the equation of required line AB
Also, since the area of the triangle ABD is 3 sq
units, we have 1 3 1 0 120 1k =± 3 This gives, 332k-= ± , i.e., k = ∓ 2
EXERCISE 4.2 1.Find area of the triangle with vertices at the point given in each of the following : (i)(1, 0), (6, 0), (4, 3) (ii)(2, 7), (1, 1), (, 8) (iii)(–2, –3), (3, 2), (–1, –8) 2.Show that points A (a, b + c ), B ( b, c + a ), C ( c, a + b ) are collinear

Definition 1 Minor of an element aij of a determinant is the determinant obtained by deleting its ith row and jth column in which element aij lies
Minor of an element aij is denoted by Mij
Remark Minor of an element of a determinant of order n(n ≥ 2) is a determinant of order n – 1
Example 8
Find the minor of element 6 in the determinant 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9∆ =
Solution
Since 6 lies in the second row and third column, its minor M is given by M =1 2 7 8 = 8 – = – 6 (obtained by deleting R2 and C3 in ∆)
Definition 2 Cofactor of an element aij, denoted by Aij is defined by Aij =(–1)i + j Mij, where Mij is minor of aij
Example 9
Find minors and cofactors of all the elements of the determinant 1 –2 4 3
Solution
Minor of the element aij is Mij Here a = 1
So M = Minor of a= 3 M = Minor of the element a = 4 M = Minor of the element a = –2 M = Minor of the element a = 1 Now , cofactor of aij is Aij
So A = (–1)1 + 1 M = (–1)2 (3) = 3 A = (–1)1 + 2 M = (–1)3 (4) = – 4 A = (–1)2 + 1 M = (–1)3 (–2) = 2 A = (–1)2 + 2 M = (–1)4 (1) = 1 DETERMINANTS Example Find minors and cofactors of the elements a, a in the determinant ∆ = a a a a a a a a a
Solution
By definition of minors and cofactors, we have Minor of a = M = a a a a = a a– a a Cofactor of a = A = (–1)1+1 M = a a – a a Minor of a = M = a a a a = a a – a a Cofactor of a = A = (–1)2+1 M = (–1) ( a a – a a) = – a a + a a Remark Expanding the determinant ∆, in Example , along R1, we have ∆ = (–1)1+1 a a a a a+ (–1)1+2 a a a a a + (–1)1+3 a a a a a = a A + a A + a A, where Aij is cofactor of aij = sum of product of elements of R1 with their corresponding cofactors Similarly , ∆ can be calculated by other five ways of expansion that is along R2, R3, C1, C2 and C3
Hence ∆ = sum of the product of elements of any row (or column) with their corresponding cofactors
ANote If elements of a row (or column) are multiplied with cofactors of any other row (or column), then their sum is zero
For example, ∆ = a A + a A + a A = a (–1)1+1 a a a a+ a (–1)1+2 a a a a+ a (–1)1+3 a a a a = a a a a a a a a a = 0 (since R1 and R2 are identical) Similarly , we can try for other rows and columns

In this section, we shall discuss the condition for existence of inverse of a matrix
To find inverse of a matrix A, i.e., A–1 we shall first define adjoint of a matrix
4.5.1 Adjoint of a matrix Definition 3 The adjoint of a square matrix A = [aij]n * n is defined as the transpose of the matrix [Aij]n * n, where Aij is the cofactor of the element aij
Adjoint of the matrix A is denoted by
Example 2
3Find A for A =1 4adj
Solution
We have A = 4, A = –1, A = –3, A = 2 Hence = A A 4 –3 =A A –1 2           Remark For a square matrix of order 2, given by A = a a a a     The can also be obtained by interchanging a and a and by changing signs of a and a, i.e., We state the following theorem without proof
Theor em 1 If A be any given square matrix of order n, then A() = () A = A I, where I is the identity matrix of order n Verification Let A = a a a a a a a a a        , then = A A A A A A A A A         Since sum of product of elements of a row (or a column) with corresponding cofactors is equal to |A| and otherwise zero, we have DETERMINANTS A () = A 0 0 0 A 0 0 0 A         = A 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1         = A I Similarly , we can show ( ) A = A I Hence A () = ( ) A = A I Definition 4 A square matrix A is said to be singular if A = 0
For example, the determinant of matrix A = 1 2 4 8   is zero Hence A is a singular matrix
Definition 5 A square matrix A is said to be non-singular if A ≠ 0 Let A = 1 2 3 4
Then A= 1 2 3 4 = 4 – 6 = – 2 ≠ 0
Hence A is a nonsingular matrix We state the following theorems without proof
Theor em 2 If A and B are nonsingular matrices of the same order , then AB and BA are also nonsingular matrices of the same order
Theorem 3 The determinant of the product of matrices is equal to product of their respective determinants, that is, AB = A B, where A and B are square matrices of the same order Remark We know th at () A = A I = A A AA0 0 0 0 0       ≠, Writing determinants of matrices on both sides, we have ( A) Aadj =A 0 0 0 A 0 0 0 A i.e
|()| |A| = 0 0 A 0 1 0 0 0 1(Why?) i.e
|()| |A| = |A|3 (1) i.e
|()| = |A|2 In general, if A is a square matrix of order n, then |adj(A)| = |A|n – 1
Theor em 4 A square matrix A is invertible if and only if A is nonsingular matrix
Proof Let A be invertible matrix of order n and I be the identity matrix of order n
Then, there exists a square matrix B of order n such that AB = BA = I Now AB = I
So AB = I or A B = 1 (since I 1, AB A B ) = = This gives A≠ 0
Hence A is nonsingular
Conversely , let A be nonsingular
Then A ≠ 0 Now A () = ( ) A = AI (Theorem 1) or A 1 1A A A I| A | | A |adj adj   = =       or AB = BA = I, where B = 1A| A |adj Thus A is invertible and A–1 = 1A| A |adj Example If A = 1 3 3 1 4 3 1 3 4      , then verify that A = |A| I
Also find A–1

If A is an invertible matrix of order 2, then det (A–1) is equal to (A) det (A) (B)1 det (A)(C) 1 (D) 0 4.6 Applications of Determinants and Matrices In this section, we shall discuss application of determinants and matrices for solving the system of linear equations in two or three variables and for checking the consistency of the system of linear equations
Consistent system A system of equations is said to be consistent if its solution (one or more) exists
Inconsistent system A system of equations is said to be inconsistent if its solution does not exist
ANote In this chapter , we restrict ourselves to the system of linear equations having unique solutions only

Solution
of system of linear equations using inverse of a matrix Let us express the system of linear equations as matrix equations and solve them using inverse of the coefficient matrix
Consider the system of equations a1 x + b1 y + c1 z = d1 a2 x + b2 y + c2 z =d2 a3 x + b3 y + c3 z =d3 Let A =1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 3 3 3 3, X and Ba b c x d a b c y d a b c z d           = =                 Then, the system of equations can be written as, AX = B, i.e., 1 1 1 2 2 2 3 3 3a b c x a b c y a b c z                   =1 2 3d d d         Case I If A is a nonsingular matrix, then its inverse exists
Now AX = B or A–1 (AX) = A–1 B (premultiplying by A–1) or (A–1A) X = A–1 B (by associative property) or I X = A–1 B or X =A–1 B This matrix equation provides unique solution for the given system of equations as inverse of a matrix is unique
This method of solving system of equations is known as Matrix Method
Case II If A is a singular matrix, then |A| = 0
In this case, we calculate ( ) B
If () B ≠ O, (O being zero matrix), then solution does not exist and the system of equations is called inconsistent
DETERMINANTS If () B = O, then system may be either consistent or inconsistent according as the system have either infinitely many solutions or no solution
Example Solve the system of equations 2x + 5y = 1 3x + 2y = 7
Solution
The system of equations can be written in the form AX = B, where A =2 5 1,X and B3 2 7x y     = =            Now , A = –1 1 ≠ 0, Hence, A is nonsingular matrix and so has a unique solution
Note that A–1 =-- -  1 112 5 3 2 Therefore X =A–1B = – 1 112 5 3 7- -     i.e.x y     =--  =-  1 1133 113 1 Hence x =3, y = – 1 Example Solve the following system of equations by matrix method
3x – 2y + 3z =8 2x + y – z =1 4x – 3y + 2z =4
Solution
The system of equations can be written in the form AX = B, where 3 2 3 8 A 2 1 1 , X and B 1 4 3 2 4x y z-           = - = =           -      We see that A = 3 (2 – 3) + 2(4 + 4) + 3 (– 6 – 4) = – ≠ 0 Hence, A is nonsingular and so its inverse exists
Now A = –1, A = – 8, A = – A = –5, A = – 6, A = 1 A = –1, A = 9, A = 7 Therefore A–1 =1 5 1 6 91710 1 7- - -   - - -   -  So X =– 5 1 8 1A B = 8 6 9 11710 1 7 4- - -       - - -       -    i.e.x y z         = 1 134 21751 3-       - - =       -    Hence x =1, y = 2 and z = 3
Example The sum of three numbers is 6
If we multiply third number by 3 and add second number to it, we get 1 1
By adding first and third numbers, we get double of the second number
Represent it algebraically and find the numbers using matrix method
Solution
Let first, second and third numbers be denoted by x, y and z, respectively
Then, according to given conditions, we have x + y + z =6 y + 3z = x + z =2y or x – 2y + z = 0 This system can be written as A X = B, where A = 1 1 1 0 1 3 1 2 1       , X = x y z        and B = 6 0       Here () () A 1 1 6 – (0 – 3) 0 –1 9 0= + + = ≠
Now we find A = 1 (1 + 6) = 7, A = – (0 – 3) = 3, A = – 1 A = – (1 + 2) = – 3, A = 0, A = – (– 2 – 1) = 3 A = (3 – 1) = 2, A = – (3 – 0) = – 3, A = (1 – 0) = 1 Hence =7 –3 2 3 0 –3 –1 3 1         DETERMINANTS Thus A –1 =1 A adj (A) = 7 3 2 0 391 3 1– – –         Since X =A–1 B X =7 3 2 6 0 3 1191 3 1 0– – –                   orx y z        = 1 9 0 0 0 6 0- +   + +   - + +  = 1 9 9        = 1 2 3       Thus x =1, y = 2, z = 3 EXERCISE 4.5 Examine the consistency of the system of equations in Exercises 1 to 6

DETERMINANTS 103 Historical Note The Chinese method of representing the coefficients of the unknowns of several linear equations by using rods on a calculating board naturally led to the discovery of simple method of elimination
The arrangement of rods was precisely that of the numbers in a determinant
The Chinese, therefore, early developed the idea of subtracting columns and rows as in simplification of a determinant Mikami, China , pp ,
Seki Kowa, the greatest of the Japanese Mathematicians of seventeenth century in his work ‘ Kai Fukudai no Ho ’ in 1683 showed that he had the idea of determinants and of their expansion
But he used this device only in eliminating a quantity from two equations and not directly in the solution of a set of simultaneous linear equations
T
Hayashi, “ The Fakudoi and Determinants in Japanese Mathematics ,” in the proc
of the Tokyo Math
Soc., V
Vendermonde was the first to recognise determinants as independent functions
He may be called the formal founder
Laplace (1772), gave general method of expanding a determinant in terms of its complementary minors
In 1773 Lagrange treated determinants of the second and third orders and used them for purpose other than the solution of equations
In 1801, Gauss used determinants in his theory of numbers
The next great contributor was Jacques - Philippe - Marie Binet, (1812) who stated the theorem relating to the product of two matrices of m-columns and n- rows, which for the special case of m = n reduces to the multiplication theorem
Also on the same day , Cauchy (1812) presented one on the same subject
He used the word ‘determinant’ in its present sense
He gave the proof of multiplication theorem more satisfactory than Binet’ s
The greatest contributor to the theory was Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi, after this the word determinant received its final acceptance

” — ALBERT EINSTEIN 5.1 Introduction This chapter is essentially a continuation of our study of differentiation of functions in Class XI
We had learnt to differentiate certain functions like polynomial functions and trigonometric functions
In this chapter , we introduce the very important concepts of continuity , differentiability and relations between them
We will also learn dif ferentiation of inverse trigonometric functions
Further , we introduce a new class of functions called exponential and logarithmic functions
These functions lead to powerful techniques of differentiation
We illustrate certain geometrically obvious conditions through differential calculus
In the process, we will learn some fundamental theorems in this area
5.2 Continuity We start the section with two informal examples to get a feel of continuity
Consider the function 1, if 0( )2, if 0xf xx≤ =>  This function is of course defined at every point of the real line
Graph of this function is given in the Fig 5.1
One can deduce from the graph that the value of the function at nearby points on x-axis remain close to each other except at x = 0
At the points near and to the left of 0, i.e., at points like – 0.1, – 0., – 0.001, the value of the function is 1
At the points near and to the right of 0, i.e., at points like 0.1, 0.,Chapter 5 CONTINUITY AND DIFFERENTIABILITY Sir Issac Newton (1642-1727) Fig 5.1 CONTINUITY AND DIFFERENTIABILITY 105 0.001, the value of the function is 2
Using the language of left and right hand limits, we may say that the left (respectively right) hand limit of f at 0 is 1 (respectively 2)
In particular the left and right hand limits do not coincide
We also observe that the value of the function at x = 0 concides with the left hand limit
Note that when we try to draw the graph, we cannot draw it in one stroke, i.e., without lifting pen from the plane of the paper , we can not draw the graph of this function
In fact, we need to lift the pen when we come to 0 from left
This is one instance of function being not continuous at x = 0
Now , consider the function defined as fxx x() , , =≠ =  1 0 2 0i f i f This function is also defined at every point
Left and the right hand limits at x = 0 are both equal to 1
But the value of the function at x = 0 equals 2 which does not coincide with the common value of the left and right hand limits
Again, we note that we cannot draw the graph of the function without lifting the pen
This is yet another instance of a function being not continuous at x = 0
Naively , we may say that a function is continuous at a fixed point if we can draw the graph of the function around that point without lifting the pen from the plane of the paper
Mathematically , it may be phrased precisely as follows: Definition 1 Suppose f is a real function on a subset of the real numbers and let c be a point in the domain of f
Then f is continuous at c if lim ( ) ( ) x cf x f c →= More elaborately , if the left hand limit, right hand limit and the value of the function at x = c exist and equal to each other , then f is said to be continuous at x = c
Recall that if the right hand and left hand limits at x = c coincide, then we say that the common value is the limit of the function at x = c
Hence we may also rephrase the definition of continuity as follows: a function is continuous at x = c if the function is defined at x = c and if the value of the function at x = c equals the limit of the function at x = c
If f is not continuous at c, we say f is discontinuous at c and c is called a point of discontinuity of f.Fig 5.2 MA THEMA TICS 106
Example 1
Check the continuity of the function f given by f(x) = 2 x + 3 at x = 1
Solution
First note that the function is defined at the given point x = 1 and its value is 5
Then find the limit of the function at x = 1
Clearly 1 1lim ( ) lim (2 3) 2(1) 3 5 x xf x x → →= + = + = Thus1lim ( ) 5 (1) xf x f →= = Hence , f is continuous at x = 1
Example 2
Examine whether the function f given by f(x) = x2 is continuous at x = 0
Solution
First note that the function is defined at the given point x = 0 and its value is 0
Then find the limit of the function at x = 0
Clearly 2 2 0 0lim ( ) lim 0 0 x xf x x → →= = = Thus0lim ( ) 0 (0) xf x f →= = Hence , f is continuous at x = 0
Example 3
Discuss the continuity of the function f given by f(x) = | x | at x = 0
Solution
By definition f(x) =, if 0 , if 0x x x x- < ≥  Clearly the function is defined at 0 and f(0) = 0
Left hand limit of f at 0 is 0 0lim ( ) lim (– ) 0 x xf x x - -→ →= = Similarly , the right hand limit of f at 0 is 0 0lim ( ) lim 0 x xf x x + +→ →= = Thus, the left hand limit, right hand limit and the value of the function coincide at x = 0
Hence, f is continuous at x = 0
Example 4
Show that the function f given by f(x) =, if 0 1, if 0x x x+ ≠=  is not continuous at x = 0
CONTINUITY AND DIFFERENTIABILITY 107
Solution
The function is defined at x = 0 and its value at x = 0 is 1
When x ≠ 0, the function is given by a polynomial
Hence, 0lim ( ) xf x → =3 3 0lim ( 3) 0 3 3 xx →+ = + = Since the limit of f at x = 0 does not coincide wit h f(0), the function is not continuous at x = 0
It may be noted that x = 0 is the only point of discontinuity for this function
Example 5
Check the points where the constant function f(x) = k is continuous
Solution
The function is defined at all real numbers and by definition, its value at any real number equals k
Let c be any real number
Then lim ( ) x cf x → =lim x ck k →= Since f(c) = k = lim x c→ f(x) for any real number c, the function f is continuous at every real number
Example 6
Prove that the identity function on real numbers given by f(x) = x is continuous at every real number
Solution
The function is clearly defined at every point and f(c) = c for every real number c
Also, lim ( ) x cf x → =lim x cx c →= Thus, lim x c→f(x) = c = f(c) and hence the function is continuous at every real number
Having defined continuity of a function at a given point, now we make a natural extension of this definition to discuss continuity of a function
Definition 2 A real function f is said to be continuous if it is continuous at every point in the domain of f
This definition requires a bit of elaboration
Suppose f is a function defined on a closed interval [ a, b], then for f to be continuous, it needs to be continuous at every point in [ a, b] including the end points a and b
Continuity of f at a means lim ( ) x af x +→=f(a) and continuity of f at b means –lim ( ) x bf x →=f(b) Observe that lim ( ) x af x -→ and lim ( ) x bf x +→do not make sense
As a consequence of this definition, if f is defined only at one point, it is continuous ther e, i.e., if the domain of f is a singleton, f is a continuous function
MA THEMA TICS 108
Example 7
Is the function defined by f(x) = | x |, a continuous function?
Solution
We may rewrite f as f(x) =, if 0 , if 0x x x x- < ≥  By
Example 3
, we know that f is continuous at x = 0
Let c be a real number such that c < 0
Then f(c) = – c
Also lim ( ) x cf x → =lim ( ) – x cx c →- = (Why?) Since lim ( ) ( ) x cf x f c →= , f is continuous at all negative real numbers
Now , let c be a real number such that c > 0
Then f(c) = c
Also lim ( ) x cf x → =lim x cx c →= (Why?) Since lim ( ) ( ) x cf x f c →= , f is continuous at all positive real numbers
Hence, f is continuous at all points
Example 8
Discuss the continuity of the function f given by f(x) = x3 + x2 – 1
Solution
Clearly f is defined at every real number c and its value at c is c3 + c2 – 1
We also know that lim ( ) x cf x → =3 2 3 2lim ( 1) 1 x cx x c c →+ - = + - Thus lim ( ) ( ) x cf x f c →= , and hence f is continuous at every real number
This means f is a continuous function
Example 9
Discuss the continuity of the function f defined by f (x) = 1 x, x ≠ 0
Solution
Fix any non zero real number c, we have 1 1lim ( ) lim x c x cf xx c → →= = Also, since for c ≠ 0, 1( )f cc=, we have lim ( ) ( ) x cf x f c →= and hence , f is continuous at every point in the domain of f
Thus f is a continuous function
CONTINUITY AND DIFFERENTIABILITY 109 We take this opportunity to explain the concept of infinity
This we do by analysing the function f(x) = 1 x near x = 0
To carry out this analysis we follow the usual trick of finding the value of the function at real numbers close to 0
Essentially we are trying to find the right hand limit of f at 0
We tabulate this in the following (T able 5.1)
Table 5.1 x 1 0.3 0.2 0.1 = –
= –.001 = –310–n f(x).333..
5 100 = 1021000 = 10310n We observe that as x gets closer to 0 from the right, the value of f(x) shoots up higher
This may be rephrased as: the value of f(x) may be made lar ger than any given number by choosing a positive real number very close to 0
In symbols, we write 0lim ( ) xf x +→= + ∞ (to be read as: the right hand limit of f(x) at 0 is plus infinity)
We wish to emphasise that + ∞ is NOT a real number and hence the right hand limit of f at 0 does not exist (as a real number)
Similarly , the left hand limit of f at 0 may be found
The following table is self explanatory
Table 5.2 x – 1 – 0.3 – 0.2 – –1– –2– –3– –n f(x)– 1 – 3.333..
– 5 – – 102– 103– n From the Table 5.2, we deduce that the value of f(x) may be made smaller than any given number by choosing a negative real number very close to 0
In symbols, we write 0lim ( ) xf x -→= - ∞ (to be read as: the left hand limit of f(x) at 0 is minus infinity)
Again, we wish to emphasise that – ∞ is NOT a real number and hence the left hand limit of f at 0 does not exist (as a real number)
The graph of the reciprocal function given in Fig 5.3 is a geometric representation of the above mentioned facts
Fig 5.3 MA THEMA TICS 110 Example Discuss the continuity of the function f defined by f(x) =2, if 1 2, if 1x x x x+ ≤ - >
Solution
The function f is defined at all points of the real line
Case 1 If c < 1, then f(c) = c + 2
Therefore, lim ( ) lim( 2) 2 x c x cf x x c → →= + = + Thus , f is continuous at all real numbers less than 1
Case 2 If c > 1, then f(c) = c – 2
Therefore, lim ( ) lim x c x cf x → →= (x – 2) = c – 2 = f (c) Thus, f is continuous at all points x > 1
Case 3 If c = 1, then the left hand limit of f at x = 1 is – –1 1lim ( ) lim ( 2) 1 2 3 x xf x x → →= + = + = The right hand limit of f at x = 1 is 1 1lim ( ) lim ( 2) 1 2 1 x xf x x + +→ →= - = - = - Since the left and right hand limits of f at x = 1 do not coincide, f is not continuous at x = 1
Hence x = 1 is the only point of discontinuity of f
The graph of the function is given in Fig 5.4
Example 1
1 Find all the points of discontinuity of the function f defined by f(x) = 2, if 1 0, if 1 2, if 1x x x x x+ < =  - >
Solution
As in the previous example we find that f is continuous at all real numbers x ≠ 1
The left hand limit of f at x = 1 is –1 1lim ( ) lim ( 2) 1 2 3 x xf x x -→ →= + = + = The right hand limit of f at x = 1 is 1 1lim ( ) lim ( 2) 1 2 1 x xf x x + +→ →= - = - = - Since, the left and right hand limits of f at x = 1 do not coincide, f is not continuous at x = 1
Hence x = 1 is the only point of discontinuity of f
The graph of the function is given in the Fig 5.5.Fig 5.4 Fig 5.5 CONTINUITY AND DIFFERENTIABILITY 111 Example Discuss the continuity of the function defined by f(x) =2, if 0 2, if 0x x x x+ < - + >
Solution
Observe that the function is defined at all real numbers except at 0
Domain of definition of this function is D1 ∪ D2 where D1 = {x ∈ R : x < 0} and D2 = {x ∈ R : x > 0} Case 1 If c ∈ D1, then lim ( ) lim x c x cf x → →= (x + 2) = c + 2 = f (c) and hence f is continuous in D1
Case 2 If c ∈ D2, then lim ( ) lim x c x cf x → →= (– x + 2) = – c + 2 = f (c) and hence f is continuous in D2
Since f is continuous at all points in the domain of f, we deduce that f is continuous
Graph of this function is given in the Fig 5.6
Note that to graph this function we need to lift the pen from the plane of the paper , but we need to do that only for those points where the function is not defined
Example Discuss the continuity of the function f given by f(x) = 2, if 0 , if 0x x x x≥ <
Solution
Clearly the function is defined at every real number
Graph of the function is given in Fig 5.7
By inspection, it seems prudent to partition the domain of definition of f into three disjoint subsets of the real line
Let D1 = {x ∈ R : x < 0}, D2 = {0} and D3 = {x ∈ R : x > 0} Case 1 At any point in D1, we have f(x) = x2 and it is easy to see that it is continuous there (see
Example 2
)
Case 2 At any point in D3, we have f(x) = x and it is easy to see that it is continuous there (see
Example 6
).Fig 5.6 Fig 5.7 MA THEMA TICS 112 Case 3 Now we analy se the function at x = 0
The value of the function at 0 is f(0) = 0
The left hand limit of f at 0 is –2 2 0 0lim ( ) lim 0 0 x xf x x -→ →= = = The right hand limit of f at 0 is 0 0lim ( ) lim 0 x xf x x + +→ →= = Thus 0lim ( ) 0 xf x →== f(0) and hence f is continuous at 0
This means that f is continuous at every point in its domain and hence, f is a continuous function
Example Show that every polynomial function is continuous
Solution
Recall that a function p is a polynomial function if it is defined by p(x) = a0 + a1 x + ..
+ an xn for some natural number n, an ≠ 0 and ai ∈ R
Clearly this function is defined for every real number
For a fixed real number c, we have lim ( ) ( ) x cp x p c →= By definition, p is continuous at c
Since c is any real number , p is continuous at every real number and hence p is a continuous function
Example Find all the points of discontinuity of the greatest integer function defined by f(x) = [x], where [ x] denotes the greatest integer less than or equal to x
Solution
First observe that f is defined for all real numbers
Graph of the function is given in Fig 5.8
From the graph it looks like that f is discontinuous at every integral point
Below we explore, if this is true
Fig 5.8 CONTINUITY AND DIFFERENTIABILITY 113 Case 1 Let c be a real number which is not equal to any integer
It is evident from the graph that for all real numbers close to c the value of the function is equal to [ c]; i.e., lim ( ) lim [ ] [ ] x c x cf x x c → →= =
Also f(c) = [c] and hence the function is continuous at all real numbers not equal to integers
Case 2 Let c be an integer
Then we can find a suf ficiently small real number r > 0 such that [c – r] = c – 1 whereas [ c + r] = c
This, in terms of limits mean that lim x c-→f(x) = c – 1, lim x c+→f(x) = c Since these limits cannot be equal to each other for any c, the function is discontinuous at every integral point
5.2.1 Algebra of continuous functions In the previous class, after having understood the concept of limits, we learnt some algebra of limits
Analogously , now we will study some algebra of continuous functions
Since continuity of a function at a point is entirely dictated by the limit of the function at that point, it is reasonable to expect results analogous to the case of limits
Theorem 1 Suppose f and g be two real functions continuous at a real number c
Then (1) f + g is continuous at x = c
(2) f – g is continuous at x = c
(3) f
g is continuous at x = c
(4)f g     is continuous at x = c, (provided g(c) ≠ 0)
Proof We are investigating continuity of ( f + g) at x = c
Clearly it is defined at x = c
We have lim( )( ) x cf g x →+ =lim [ ( ) ( )] x cf x g x →+ (by definition of f + g) =lim ( ) lim ( ) x c x cf x g x → →+ (by the theorem on limits) =f(c) + g(c) (as f and g are continuous) =(f + g) (c) (by definition of f + g) Hence, f + g is continuous at x = c
Proofs for the remaining parts are similar and left as an exercise to the reader
MA THEMA TICS 114 Remarks (i)As a special case of (3) above, if f is a constant function, i.e., f(x) = λ for some real number λ, then the function ( λ
g) defined by ( λ
g) (x) = λ
g(x) is also continuous
In particular if λ = – 1, the continuity of f implies continuity of – f
(ii) As a special case of (4) above, if f is the constant function f(x) = λ, then the function gλ defined by ( )( )xg g xλ λ= is also continuous wherever g(x) ≠ 0
In particular , the continuity of g implies continuity of 1 g
The above theorem can be exploited to generate many continuous functions
They also aid in deciding if certain functions are continuous or not
The following examples illustrate this: Example Prove that every rational function is continuous
Solution
Recall that every rational function f is given by ( )( ) , ( ) 0( )p xf x q xq x= ≠ where p and q are polynomial functions
The domain of f is all real numbers except points at which q is zero
Since polynomial functions are continuous (Example ), f is continuous by (4) of Theorem 1
Example Discuss the continuity of sine function
Solution
To see this we use the following facts 0lim sin 0 xx →= We have not proved it, but is intuitively clear from the graph of sin x near 0
Now , observe that f(x) = sin x is defined for every real number
Let c be a real number
Put x = c + h
If x → c we know that h → 0
Therefore lim ( ) x cf x → =lim sin x cx → =0lim sin( ) hc h →+ =0lim [sin cos cos sin ] hc h c h →+ =0 0lim [sin cos ] lim [cos sin ] h hc h c h → →+ =sin c + 0 = sin c = f(c) Thus lim x c→ f(x) = f(c) and hence f is a continuous function
CONTINUITY AND DIFFERENTIABILITY 115 Remark A similar proof may be given for the continuity of cosine function
Example Prove that the function defined by f(x) = tan x is a continuous function
Solution
The function f(x) = tan x = sin cosx x
This is defined for all real numbers such that cos x ≠ 0, i.e., x ≠ (2n +1)2π
We have just proved that both sine and cosine functions are continuous
Thus tan x being a quotient of two continuous functions is continuous wherever it is defined
An interesting fact is the behaviour of continuous functions with respect to composition of functions
Recall that if f and g are two real functions, then (f o g) (x) = f(g(x)) is defined whenever the range of g is a subset of domain of f
The following theorem (stated without proof) captures the continuity of composite functions
Theorem 2 Suppose f and g are real valued functions such that ( f o g) is defined at c
If g is continuous at c and if f is continuous at g(c), then ( f o g) is continuous at c
The following examples illustrate this theorem
Example Show that the function defined by f(x) = sin ( x2) is a continuous function
Solution
Observe that the function is defined for every real number
The function f may be thought of as a composition g o h of the two functions g and h, where g(x) = sin x and h(x) = x2
Since both g and h are continuous functions, by Theorem 2, it can be deduced that f is a continuous function
Example Show that the function f defined by f(x) =|1 – x + |x||, where x is any real number , is a continuous function
Solution
Define g by g(x) = 1 – x + |x| and h by h(x) = |x| for all real x
Then (h o g) (x) =h(g(x)) =h(1– x + |x|) =|1– x + |x|| = f(x) In
Example 7
, we have seen that h is a continuous function
Hence g being a sum of a polynomial function and the modulus function is continuous
But then f being a composite of two continuous functions is continuous

5.3
Differentiability Recall the following facts from previous class
We had defined the derivative of a real function as follows: Suppose f is a real function and c is a point in its domain
The derivative of f at c is defined by 0( ) ( )lim hf c h f c h →+ - CONTINUITY AND DIFFERENTIABILITY 119 f(x) xnsin x cos x tan x f′(x) nxn–1cos x – sin x sec2 xprovided this limit exists
Derivative of f at c is denoted by f′(c) or ( ( )) |cdf xdx
The function defined by 0( ) ( )( ) lim hf x h f xf xh →+ -′= wherever the limit exists is defined to be the derivative of f
The derivative of f is denoted by f′(x) or ( ( ))df xdxor if y = f(x) by dy dxor y′
The process of finding derivative of a function is called dif ferentiation
We also use the phrase differ entiate f(x) with r espect to x to mean find f′(x)
The following rules were established as a part of algebra of derivatives: (1) (u ±)′ = u′ ±′ (2) (uv)′ = u′+ uv′ (Leibnitz or product rule) (3) 2u u uv′′ - ′  =   , wherever ≠ 0 (Quotient rule)
The following table gives a list of derivatives of certain standard functions: Table 5.3 Whenever we defined derivative, we had put a caution provided the limit exists
Now the natural question is; what if it doesn’t? The question is quite pertinent and so is its answer
If 0( ) ( )lim hf c h f c h →+ - does not exist , we say that f is not dif ferentiable at c
In other words, we say that a function f is differentiable at a point c in its domain if both –0( ) ( )lim hf c h f c h →+ - and 0( ) ( )lim hf c h f c h+→+ - are finite and equal
A function is said to be dif ferentiable in an interval [ a, b] if it is dif ferentiable at every point of [ a, b]
As in case of continuity , at the end points a and b, we take the right hand limit and left hand limit, which are nothing but left hand derivative and right hand derivative of the function at a and b respectively
Similarly , a function is said to be dif ferentiable in an interval (a, b) if it is differentiable at every point of ( a, b)
MA THEMA TICS 120 Theorem 3 If a function f is differentiable at a point c, then it is also continuous at that point
Proof Since f is differentiable at c, we have ( ) ( )lim ( ) x cf x f cf cx c →-= ′- But for x ≠ c, we have f(x) – f(c) =( ) ( )
( )f x f cx cx c--- Therefore lim [ ( ) ( )] x cf x f c →- =( ) ( )lim
( ) x cf x f cx cx c →-  - -   or lim [ ( )] lim [ ( )] x c x cf x f c → →- =( ) ( )lim
lim [( )] x c x cf x f cx cx c → →-  - -   =f′(c)
0 = 0 or lim ( ) x cf x → =f(c) Hence f is continuous at x = c
Corollary 1 Every differentiable function is continuous
We remark that the converse of the above statement is not true
Indeed we have seen that the function defined by f(x) = |x| is a continuous function
Consider the left hand limit –0(0 ) (0)lim 1 hf h f h h h →+ - -= = - The right hand limit 0(0 ) (0)lim 1 hf h f h h h+→+ -= = Since the above left and right hand limits at 0 are not equal, 0(0 ) (0)lim hf h f h →+ - does not exist and hence f is not differentiable at 0
Thus f is not a differentiable function
5.3.1 Derivatives of composite functions To study derivative of composite functions, we start with an illustrative example
Say , we want to find the derivative of f, where f(x) =(2x + 1)3 CONTINUITY AND DIFFERENTIABILITY 121 One way is to expand (2 x + 1)3 using binomial theorem and find the derivative as a polynomial function as illustrated below
( )df xdx =3(2 1)dxdx  +   =3 2(8 6 1)dx x xdx+ + + =x2 + x + 6 =6 (2x + 1)2 Now , observe that f(x) =(h o g) (x) where g(x) = 2 x + 1 and h(x) = x3
Put t = g(x) = 2 x + 1
Then f(x) = h(t) = t3
Thus df dx =6 (2x + 1)2 = 3(2 x + 1)2
2 = 3 t2
2 = dh dt dt dx⋅ The advantage with such observation is that it simplifies the calculation in finding the derivative of, say , (2x + 1)100
We may formalise this observation in the following theorem called the chain rule
Theorem 4 (Chain Rule) Let f be a real valued function which is a composite of two functions u and; i.e., f = o u
Suppose t = u(x) and if both dt dx and dv dt exist , we have df dv dt dx dt dx= ⋅ We skip the proof of this theorem
Chain rule may be extended as follows
Suppose f is a real valued function which is a composite of three functions u, and w; i.e., f = (w o u) o
If t =(x) and s = u(t), then ( o ) df d w u dt dw ds dt dx dt dx ds dt dx= ⋅ = ⋅ ⋅ provided all the derivatives in the statement exist
Reader is invited to formulate chain rule for composite of more functions
Example Find the derivative of the function given by f(x) = sin ( x2)
Solution
Observe that the given function is a composite of two functions
Indeed, if t = u(x) = x2 and(t) = sin t, then f(x) = (o u) (x) =(u(x)) =(x2) = sin x2 MA THEMA TICS 122 Put t = u(x) = x2
Observe that cosdvtdt= and 2dtxdx= exist
Hence, by chain rule df dx = cos 2dv dtt xdt dx⋅ = ⋅ It is normal practice to express the final result only in terms of x
Thus df dx =2cos 2 2 cost x x x⋅ = EXERCISE 5.2 Differentiate the functions with respect to x in Exercises 1 to 8

Prove that the greatest integer function defined by f(x) =[x], 0 < x < 3 is not differentiable at x = 1 and x = 2
5.3.2 Derivatives of implicit functions Until now we have been differentiating various functions given in the form y = f(x)
But it is not necessary that functions are always expressed in this form
For example, consider one of the following relationships between x and y: x – y – π =0 x + sin xy – y =0 In the first case, we can solve for y and rewrite the relationship as y = x – π
In the second case, it does not seem that there is an easy way to solve for y
Nevertheless, there is no doubt about the dependence of y on x in either of the cases
When a relationship between x and y is expressed in a way that it is easy to solve for y and write y = f(x), we say that y is given as an explicit function of x
In the latter case it CONTINUITY AND DIFFERENTIABILITY 123 is implicit that y is a function of x and we say that the relationship of the second type, above, gives function implicitly
In this subsection, we learn to dif ferentiate implicit functions
Example Find dy dx if x – y = π
Solution
One way is to solve for y and rewrite the above as y =x – π But thendy dx =1 Alternatively , directly differentiating the relationship w .r.t., x, we have ( )dx ydx- = d dxπ Recall that d dxπ means to differentiate the constant function taking value π everywhere w .r.t., x
Thus ( ) ( )d dx ydx dx- =0 which implies that dy dx = 1dx dx= Example Find dy dx, if y + sin y = cos x
Solution
We differentiate the relationship directly with respect to x, i.e., (sin )dy dydx dx+ = (cos )dxdx which implies using chain rule cosdy dyydx dx+ ⋅ =– sin x This givesdy dx =sin 1 cosx y-+ where y ≠(2n + 1) π MA THEMA TICS 124 5.3.3 Derivatives of inverse trigonometric functions We remark that inverse trigonometric functions are continuous functions, but we will not prove this
Now we use chain rule to find derivatives of these functions
Example Find the derivative of f given by f(x) = sin–1 x assuming it exists
Solution
Let y = sin–1 x
Then, x = sin y
Differentiating both sides w .r.t
x, we get 1 =cos y dy dx which implies thatdy dx = 1 cos cos(sin )y x-= Observe that this is defined only for cos y ≠ 0, i.e., sin–1 x ≠ ,2 2π π- , i.e., x ≠ – 1, 1, i.e., x ∈ (– 1, 1)
To make this result a bit more attractive, we carry out the following manipulation
Recall that for x ∈ (– 1, 1), sin (sin–1 x) = x and hence cos2 y = 1 – (sin y)2 = 1 – (sin (sin–1 x))2 = 1 – x2 Also, since y ∈ ,2 2π π -  , cos y is positive and hence cos y = x- Thus, for x ∈ (– 1, 1), 1 cos 1dy dx y x= = - 1x- 1x- - 1x+f(x) sin–1 x cos-1 x tan-1x Domain off (-1, 1) (-1, 1) Rf1(x) CONTINUITY AND DIFFERENTIABILITY 125 EXERCISE 5.3 Find dy dx in the following: 1.2x + 3y = sin x 2.2x + 3y = sin y 3.ax + by2 = cos y 4.xy + y2 = tan x + y5.x2 + xy + y2 = 100 6.x3 + x2y + xy2 + y3 = 7.sin2 y + cos xy = κ8.sin2 x + cos2 y = 1 9.y = sin–1 1x x  +

In this section, we shall learn about a new class of (related) functions called exponential functions and logarithmic functions
It needs to be emphasized that many statements made in this section are motivational and precise proofs of these are well beyond the scope of this text
The Fig 5.9 gives a sketch of y = f1(x) = x, y = f2(x) = x2, y = f3(x) = x3 and y = f4(x) = x4
Observe that the curves get steeper as the power of x increases
Steeper the curve, faster is the rate of growth
What this means is that for a fixed increment in the value of x(> 1), the increment in the value of y = fn (x) increases as n increases for n = 1, 2, 3, 4
It is conceivable that such a statement is true for all positive values of n, MA THEMA TICS 126 where fn (x) = xn
Essentially , this means that the graph of y = fn (x) leans more towards the y-axis as n increases
For example, consider f(x) = x and f(x) = x
If x increases from 1 to 2, f increases from 1 to 210 whereas f increases from 1 to 215
Thus, for the same increment in x, f grow faster than f
Upshot of the above discussion is that the growth of polynomial functions is dependent on the degree of the polynomial function – higher the degree, greater is the growth
The next natural question is: Is there a function which grows faster than any polynomial function
The answer is in affirmative and an example of such a function is y = f(x) = x
Our claim is that this function f grows faster than fn (x) = xn for any positive integer n
For example, we can prove that x grows faster than f100 (x) = x100
For large values of x like x = 103, note that f100 (x) = (103)100 = 10300 whereas f(103) = 31010 = 101000
Clearly f(x) is much greater than f100 (x)
It is not difficult to prove that for all x > 103, f(x) > f100 (x)
But we will not attempt to give a proof of this here
Similarly , by choosing large values of x, one can verify that f(x) grows faster than fn (x) for any positive integer n
Definition 3 The exponential function with positive base b > 1 is the function y = f(x) = bx The graph of y = x is given in the Fig 5.9
It is advised that the reader plots this graph for particular values of b like 2, 3 and 4
Following are some of the salient features of the exponential functions: (1) Domain of the exponential function is R, the set of all real numbers
(2) Range of the exponential function is the set of all positive real numbers
(3) The point (0, 1) is always on the graph of the exponential function (this is a restatement of the fact that b0 = 1 for any real b > 1)
(4) Exponential function is ever increasing; i.e., as we move from left to right, the graph rises above.Fig 5.9 CONTINUITY AND DIFFERENTIABILITY 127 (5) For very large negative values of x, the exponential function is very close to 0
In other words, in the second quadrant, the graph approaches x-axis (but never meets it)
Exponential function with base is called the common exponential function
In the Appendix
A.1.4 of
Class XI, it was observed that the sum of the series 1 ...1! 2!+ + + is a number between 2 and 3 and is denoted by e
Using this e as the base we obtain an extremely important exponential function y = ex
This is called natural exponential function
It would be interesting to know if the inverse of the exponential function exists and has nice interpretation
This search motivates the following definition
Definition 4 Let b > 1 be a real number
Then we say logarithm of a to base b is x if bx = a
Logarithm of a to base b is denoted by logb a
Thus logb a = x if bx = a
Let us work with a few explicit examples to get a feel for this
We know = 8
In terms of logarithms, we may rewrite this as log2 8 = 3
Similarly , 104 = 10000 is equivalent to saying log 10000 = 4
Also, 625 = = 252 is equivalent to saying log5 625 = 4 or log 625 = 2
On a slightly more mature note, fixing a base b > 1, we may look at logarithm as a function from positive real numbers to all real numbers
This function, called the logarithmic function , is defined by logb : R+ →R x →logb x = y if by = x As before if the base b = , we say it is common logarithms and if b = e, then we say it is natural logarithms
Often natural logarithm is denoted by ln
In this chapter , log x denotes the logarithm function to base e , i.e., ln x will be written as simpl y log x
The Fig 5
gives the plots of logarithm function to base 2, e and
Some of the important observations about the logarithm function to any base b > 1 are listed below: Fig 5
MA THEMA TICS 128 Fig 5.1 1(1) We cannot make a meaningful definition of logarithm of non-positive numbers and hence the domain of log function is R+
(2) The range of log function is the set of all real numbers
(3) The point (1, 0) is always on the graph of the log function
(4) The log function is ever increasing, i.e., as we move from left to right the graph rises above
(5) For x very near to zero, the value of log x can be made lesser than any given real number
In other words in the fourth quadrant the graph approaches y-axis (but never meets it)
(6) Fig 5.1 1 gives the plot of y = ex and y = ln x
It is of interest to observe that the two curves are the mirror images of each other reflected in the line y = x
Two properties of ‘log’ functions are proved below: (1) There is a standard change of base rule to obtain loga p in terms of logb p
Let loga p = α, logb p = β and logb a = γ
This means aα = p, bβ = p and bγ = a
Substituting the third equation in the first one, we have (bγ)α =bγα = p Using this in the second equation, we get bβ =p = bγα which implies β = αγ or α =β γ
But then loga p =log logb bp a (2) Another interesting property of the log function is its effect on products
Let logb pq = α
Then bα = pq
If logb p = β and logb q = γ, then bβ = p and bγ = q
But then bα = pq = bβbγ = bβ + γ which implies α = β + γ, i.e., logb pq =logb p + logb q CONTINUITY AND DIFFERENTIABILITY 129 A particularly interesting and important consequence of this is when p = q
In this case the above may be rewritten as logb p2 = logb p + logb p = 2 log p An easy generalisation of this (left as an exercise!) is logb pn =n log p for any positive integer n
In fact this is true for any real number n, but we will not attempt to prove this
On the similar lines the reader is invited to verify logbx y =logb x – logb y Example Is it true that x = elog x for all real x?
Solution
First, observe that the domain of log function is set of all positive real numbers
So the above equation is not true for non-positive real numbers
Now , let y = elog x
If y > 0, we may take logarithm which gives us log y = log ( elog x) = log x
log e = log x
Thus y = x
Hence x = elog x is true only for positive values of x
One of the striking properties of the natural exponential function in differential calculus is that it doesn’t change during the process of differentiation
This is captured in the following theorem whose proof we skip
Theorem 5* (1) The derivative of ex w.r.t., x is ex; i.e., d dx(ex) = ex
(2) The derivative of log x w.r.t., x is 1 x; i.e., d dx(log x) = 1 x

Logarithmic Differentiation In this section, we will learn to differentiate certain special class of functions given in the form y =f(x) = [ u(x)](x) By taking logarithm (to base e) the above may be rewritten as log y =v(x) log [ u(x)] Using chain rule we may differentiate this to get 1 1( )( )dyv xy dx u x⋅ = ⋅
u′(x) +′(x)
log [ u(x)] which implies that [ ]( )( ) ( ) log ( )( )dy xy u x x u xdx u x = ⋅ ′ + ′ ⋅   The main point to be noted in this method is that f(x) and u(x) must always be positive as otherwise their logarithms are not defined

5.6 Derivatives of Functions in Parametric Forms Some times the relation between two variables is neither explicit nor implicit, but some link of a third variable with each of the two variables, separately , establishes a relation between the first two variables
In such a situation, we say that the relation between CONTINUITY AND DIFFERENTIABILITY 135 them is expressed via a third variable
The third variable is called the parameter
More precisely , a relation expressed between two variables x and y in the form x = f(t), y = g(t) is said to be parametric form with t as a parameter

—vv— vWith the Calculus as a key , Mathematics can be successfully applied to the explanation of the course of Nature.” — WHITEHEAD 6.1Introduction In Chapter 5, we have learnt how to find derivative of composite functions, inverse trigonometric functions, implicit functions, exponential functions and logarithmic functions
In this chapter , we will study applications of the derivative in various disciplines, e.g., in engineering, science, social science, and many other fields
For instance, we will learn how the derivative can be used (i) to determine rate of change of quantities, (ii) to find the equations of tangent and normal to a curve at a point, (iii) to find turning points on the graph of a function which in turn will help us to locate points at which largest or smallest value (locally) of a function occurs
We will also use derivative to find intervals on which a function is increasing or decreasing
Finally , we use the derivative to find approximate value of certain quantities
6.2Rate of Change of Quantities Recall that by the derivative ds dt, we mean the rate of change of distance s with respect to the time t
In a similar fashion, whenever one quantity y varies with another quantity x, satisfying some rule ( ) y f x= , then dy dx (or f′(x)) represents the rate of change of y with respect to x and dy dxx x  =0 (or f′(x0)) represents the rate of change of y with respect to x at 0 x x=
Further , if two variables x and y are varying with respect to another variable t, i.e., if ( ) x f t= and ( ) y g t= , then by Chain Rule dy dx =dy dx dt dt, if 0dx dt≠Chapter 6 APPLICA TION OF DERIV ATIVES MA THEMA TICS 148 Thus, the rate of change of y with respect to x can be calculated using the rate of change of y and that of x both with respect to t
Let us consider some examples
Example 1
Find the rate of change of the area of a circle per second with respect to its radius r when r = 5 cm
Solution
The area A of a circle with radius r is given by A = πr2
Therefore, the rate of change of the area A with respect to its radius r is given by 2 A( ) 2d dr rdr dr= π = π
When r = 5 cm, Ad dr= π
Thus, the area of the circle is changing at the rate of π cm2/s

Consider the function f given by f(x) = x2, x Î R
The graph of this function is a parabola as given in Fig 6.1
Fig 6.1 First consider the graph (Fig 6.1) to the right of the origin
Observe that as we move from left to right along the graph, the height of the graph continuously increases
For this reason, the function is said to be increasing for the real numbers x > 0
Now consider the graph to the left of the origin and observe here that as we move from left to right along the graph, the height of the graph continuously decreases
Consequently , the function is said to be decreasing for the real numbers x < 0
We shall now give the following analytical definitions for a function which is increasing or decreasing on an interval
Definition 1 Let I be an interval contained in the domain of a real valued function f
Then f is said to be (i)increasing on I if x1 < x2 in I Þ f(x1) < f(x2) for all x1, x2 Î I
(ii) decreasing on I, if x1 < x2 in I Þ f(x1) > f(x2) for all x1, x2 Î I
(iii) constant on I, if f(x) = c for all x Î I, where c is a constant.x f (x) = x2 –2 4 3 29 4 –1 1 1 21 4 0 0Values left to origin as we move from left to right, the height of the graph decreasesx f (x) = x2 0 0 1 4 1 1 3 4 2 4Values right to origin as we move from left to right, the height of the graph increases APPLICA TION OF DERIV ATIVES 153 (iv) strictly increasing on I if x1 < x2 in I Þ f(x1) < f(x2) for all x1, x2 Î I
(v) strictly decreasing on I if x1 < x2 in I Þ f(x1) > f(x2) for all x1, x2 Î I
For graphical representation of such functions see Fig 6.2
Fig 6.2 We shall now define when a function is increasing or decreasing at a point
Definition 2 Let x0 be a point in the domain of definition of a real valued function f
Then f is said to be increasing, decreasing at x0 if there exists an open interval I containing x0 such that f is increasing, decreasing, respectively , in I
Let us clarify this definition for the case of increasing function
Example 7
Show that the function given by f(x) = 7 x – 3 is increasing on R
Solution
Let x1 and x2 be any two numbers in R
Then x1 < x2 Þ 7x1 < 7x2 Þ 7x1 – 3 < 7 x2 – 3 Þ f(x1) < f(x2) Thus, by Definition 1, it follows that f is strictly increasing on R
We shall now give the first derivative test for increasing and decreasing functions
The proof of this test requires the Mean Value Theorem studied in Chapter 5
Theorem 1 Let f be continuous on [ a, b] and differentiable on the open interval (a,b)
Then (a) f is increasing in [ a,b] if f¢(x) > 0 for each x Î (a, b) (b) f is decreasing in [ a,b] if f¢(x) < 0 for each x Î (a, b) (c) f is a constant function in [ a,b] if f¢(x) = 0 for each x Î (a, b)Strictly Incr easing function (i)Neither Increasing nor Decreasing function (iii)Strictly Decr easing function (ii) MA THEMA TICS 154 Proof (a) Let x1, x2 Î [a, b] be such that x1 < x2
Then, by Mean Value Theorem (Theorem 8 in Chapter 5), there exists a point c between x1 and x2 such that f(x2) –f(x1) = f¢(c) (x2 – x1) i.e
f(x2) –f(x1) > 0 (as f¢(c) > 0 (given)) i.e
f(x2) >f(x1) Thus, we have 1 2 1 2 1 2 ( ) ( ), for all , [ , ] x x f x f x x x a b    Hence, f is an increasing function in [ a,b]
The proofs of part (b) and (c) are similar
It is left as an exercise to the reader
Remarks There is a more generalised theorem, which states that if f¢(x) > 0 for x in an interval excluding the end points and f is continuous in the interval, then f is increasing
Similarly , if f¢(x) < 0 for x in an interval excluding the end points and f is continuous in the interval, then f is decreasing
Example 8
Show that the function f given by f(x) =x3 – 3x2 + 4x, x Î R is increasing on R
Solution
Note that f¢(x) =3x2 – 6x + 4 =3(x2 – 2x + 1) + 1 =3(x – 1)2 + 1 > 0, in every interval of R Therefore, the function f is increasing on R
Example 9
Prove that the function given by f(x) = cos x is (a) decreasing in (0, p) (b) increasing in ( p, 2p), and (c) neither increasing nor decreasing in (0, 2 p)
APPLICA TION OF DERIV ATIVES 155 Fig 6.4
Solution
Note that f′(x) = – sin x (a) Since for each x ∈ (0, π), sin x > 0, we have f′(x) < 0 and so f is decreasing in (0, π)
(b) Since for each x ∈ (π, 2π), sin x < 0, we have f′(x) > 0 and so f is increasing in (π, 2π)
(c) Clearly by (a) and (b) above, f is neither increasing nor decreasing in (0, 2 π)
Example Find the intervals in which the function f given by f(x) = x2 – 4x + 6 is (a)increasing (b) decreasing
Solution
We have f(x)=x2 – 4x + 6 or f′(x)=2x – 4 Therefore, f′(x) = 0 gives x = 2
Now the point x = 2 divides the real line into two disjoint intervals namely , (– ∞, 2) and (2, ∞) (Fig 6.3)
In the interval (– ∞, 2), f′(x) = 2x – 4 < 0
Therefore, f is decreasing in this interval
Also, in the interval (2, )∞, ( ) 0f x >′ and so the function f is increasing in this interval
Example 1
1 Find the intervals in which the function f given by f (x) = 4x3 – 6x2 – x + is (a) increasing (b) decreasing
Solution
We have f(x)=4x3 – 6x2 – x + or f′(x)=x2 – x – =(x2 – x – 6) =(x – 3) ( x + 2) Therefore, f′(x) = 0 gives x = – 2, 3
The points x = – 2 and x = 3 divides the real line into three disjoint intervals, namely , (– ∞, – 2), (– 2, 3) and (3, ∞).Fig 6.3 MA THEMA TICS 156 In the intervals (– ∞, – 2) and (3, ∞), f′(x) is positive while in the interval (– 2, 3), f′(x) is negative
Consequently , the function f is increasing in the intervals (– ∞, – 2) and (3, ∞) while the function is decreasing in the interval (– 2, 3)
However , f is neither increasing nor decreasing in R

Solution
We have f(x) =sin 3 x or f′(x) =3cos 3 x Therefore, f′(x) = 0 gives cos 3 x = 0 which in turn gives ,2 2xπ π= (as x∈  , π implies 0,2xπ ∈  )
So 6xπ= and 2π
The point 6xπ= divides the interval , π   into two disjoint intervals 0,6π    and π π 6 2,
Now , ( ) 0f x >′ for all 0,6xπ ∈  as 0 0 2x xπ π≤ < ⇒ ≤ < and ( ) 0f x <′ for all ,6 2xπ π ∈   as 336 2 2 2x xπ π π π< < ⇒ < <
Therefore, f is increasing in 0,6π    and decreasing in ,6 2π π   .Fig 6.5 APPLICA TION OF DERIV ATIVES 157 Also, the given function is continuous at x = 0 and 6xπ=
Therefore, by Theorem 1, f is increasing on , π   and decreasing on π π 6 2,
Example Find the intervals in which the function f given by f(x) = sin x + cos x, 0 ≤ x ≤ 2π is increasing or decreasing

In fact, we will find the ‘turning points’ of the graph of a function and thus find points at which the graph reaches its highest (or MA THEMA TICS 160 lowest) locally
The knowledge of such points is very useful in sketching the graph of a given function
Further , we will also find the absolute maximum and absolute minimum of a function that are necessary for the solution of many applied problems
Let us consider the following problems that arise in day to day life
(i)The profit from a grove of orange trees is given by P( x) = ax + bx2, where a,b are constants and x is the number of orange trees per acre
How many trees per acre will maximise the profit? (ii) A ball, thrown into the air from a building metres high, travels along a path given by 2 ( ) 6060xh x x = + - , where x is the horizontal distance from the building and h(x) is the height of the ball
What is the maximum height the ball will reach? (iii) An Apache helicopter of enemy is flying along the path given by the curve f (x) = x2 + 7
A soldier , placed at the point (1, 2), wants to shoot the helicopter when it is nearest to him
What is the nearest distance? In each of the above problem, there is something common, i.e., we wish to find out the maximum or minimum values of the given functions
In order to tackle such problems, we first formally define maximum or minimum values of a function, points of local maxima and minima and test for determining such points
Definition 3 Let f be a function defined on an interval I
Then (a) f is said to have a maximum value in I, if there exists a point c in I such that ( ) ( )> f c f x , for all x ∈ I
The number f(c) is called the maximum value of f in I and the point c is called a point of maximum value of f in I
(b) f is said to have a minimum value in I, if there exists a point c in I such that f(c) < f(x), for all x ∈ I
The number f(c), in this case, is called the minimum value of f in I and the point c, in this case, is called a point of minimum value of f in I
(c) f is said to have an extreme value in I if there exists a point c in I such that f (c) is either a maximum value or a minimum value of f in I
The number f(c), in this case, is called an extreme value of f in I and the point c is called an extreme point
Remark In Fig 6.7(a), (b) and (c), we have exhibited that graphs of certain particular functions help us to find maximum value and minimum value at a point
Infact, through graphs, we can even find maximum/minimum value of a function at a point at which it is not even differentiable (Example )
APPLICA TION OF DERIV ATIVES 161 Fig 6.7 Example Find the maximum and the minimum values, if any, of the function f given by f(x) =x2, x ∈ R
Solution
From the graph of the given function (Fig 6.8), we have f(x) = 0 if x = 0
Also f(x) ≥0, for all x ∈ R
Therefore, the minimum value of f is 0 and the point of minimum value of f is x = 0
Further , it may be observed from the graph of the function that f has no maximum value and hence no point of maximum value of f in R
ANote If we restrict the domain of f to [– 2, 1] only , then f will have maximum value(– 2)2 = 4 at x = – 2
Example Find the maximum and minimum values of f , if any , of the function given by f(x) = |x|, x ∈ R
Solution
From the graph of the given function (Fig 6.9) , note that f(x) ≥ 0, for all x ∈ R and f(x) = 0 if x = 0
Therefore, the function f has a minimum value 0 and the point of minimum value of f is x = 0
Also, the graph clearly shows that f has no maximum value in R and hence no point of maximum value in R
ANote (i)If we restrict the domain of f to [– 2, 1] only , then f will have maximum value |– 2| = 2.Fig 6.8 Fig 6.9 MA THEMA TICS 162 Fig 6.(ii) One may note that the function f in Example is not differentiable at x = 0
Example Find the maximum and the minimum values, if any , of the function given by f(x) =x, x ∈ (0, 1)
Solution
The given function is an increasing (strictly) function in the given interval (0, 1)
From the graph (Fig 6.) of the function f , it seems that, it should have the minimum value at a point closest to 0 on its right and the maximum value at a point closest to 1 on its left
Are such points available? Of course, not
It is not possible to locate such points
Infact, if a point x0 is closest to 0, then we find 0 xx< for all 0(0,1)x∈
Also, if x1 is closest to 1, then 1 2xx+> for all 1(0,1)x∈
Therefore, the given function has neither the maximum value nor the minimum value in the interval (0,1)
Remark The reader may observe that in Example , if we include the points 0 and 1 in the domain of f , i.e., if we extend the domain of f to [0,1], then the function f has minimum value 0 at x = 0 and maximum value 1 at x = 1
Infact, we have the following results (The proof of these results are beyond the scope of the present text) Every monotonic function assumes its maximum/minimum value at the end points of the domain of definition of the function
A more general result is Every continuous function on a closed interval has a maximum and a minimum value
ANote By a monotonic function f in an interval I, we mean that f is either increasing in I or decreasing in I
Maximum and minimum values of a function defined on a closed interval will be discussed later in this section
Let us now examine the graph of a function as shown in Fig 6.1 1
Observe that at points A, B, C and D on the graph, the function changes its nature from decreasing to increasing or vice-versa
These points may be called turning points of the given function
Further , observe that at turning points, the graph has either a little hill or a little valley
Roughly speaking, the function has minimum value in some neighbourhood (interval) of each of the points A and C which are at the bottom of their respective APPLICA TION OF DERIV ATIVES 163 valleys
Similarly , the function has maximum value in some neighbourhood of points B and D which are at the top of their respective hills
For this reason, the points A and C may be regarded as points of local minimum value (or relative minimum value ) and points B and D may be regarded as points of local maximum value (or relative maximum value ) for the function
The local maximum value and local minimum value of the function are referred to as local maxima and local minima , respectively , of the function
We now formally give the following definition Definition 4 Let f be a real valued function and let c be an interior point in the domain of f
Then (a) c is called a point of local maxima if there is an h > 0 such that f(c) ≥ f(x), for all x in (c – h, c + h), x ≠ c The value f(c) is called the local maximum value of f
(b) c is called a point of local minima if there is an h > 0 such that f(c) ≤ f(x), for all x in (c – h, c + h) The value f(c) is called the local minimum value of f
Geometrically , the above definition states that if x = c is a point of local maxima of f, then the graph of f around c will be as shown in Fig 6.(a)
Note that the function f is increasing (i.e., f′(x) > 0) in the interval ( c – h, c) and decreasing (i.e., f′(x) < 0) in the interval ( c, c + h)
This suggests that f′(c) must be zero.Fig 6.1 1 Fig 6
MA THEMA TICS 164 Fig 6.Similarly , if c is a point of local minima of f , then the graph of f around c will be as shown in Fig 6.(b)
Here f is decreasing (i.e., f′(x) < 0) in the interval ( c – h, c) and increasing (i.e., f′(x) > 0) in the interval ( c, c + h)
This again suggest that f′(c) must be zero
The above discussion lead us to the following theorem (without proof)
Theorem 2 Let f be a function defined on an open interval I
Suppose c ∈ I be any point
If f has a local maxima or a local minima at x = c, then either f′(c) = 0 or f is not differentiable at c
Remark The converse of above theorem need not be true, that is, a point at which the derivative vanishes need not be a point of local maxima or local minima
For example, if f(x) = x3, then f′(x) = 3 x2 and so f′(0) = 0
But 0 is neither a point of local maxima nor a point of local minima (Fig 6.)
ANote A point c in the domain of a function f at which either f′(c) = 0 or f is not differentiable is called a critical point of f
Note that if f is continuous at c and f′(c) = 0, then there exists an h > 0 such that f is differentiable in the interval (c – h, c + h)
We shall now give a working rule for finding points of local maxima or points of local minima using only the first order derivatives
Theor em 3 (First Derivative Test) Let f be a function defined on an open interval I
Let f be continuous at a critical point c in I
Then (i)If f′(x) changes sign from positive to negative as x increases through c, i.e., if f′(x) > 0 at every point sufficiently close to and to the left of c, and f′(x) < 0 at every point sufficiently close to and to the right of c, then c is a point of local maxima
(ii) If f′(x) changes sign from negative to positive as x increases through c, i.e., if f′(x) < 0 at every point sufficiently close to and to the left of c, and f′(x) > 0 at every point sufficiently close to and to the right of c, then c is a point of local minima
(iii) If f′(x) does not change sign as x increases through c, then c is neither a point of local maxima nor a point of local minima
Infact, such a point is called point of inflection (Fig 6.)
APPLICA TION OF DERIV ATIVES 165 ANote If c is a point of local maxima of f , then f(c) is a local maximum value of f
Similarly , if c is a point of local minima of f , then f(c) is a local minimum value of f

and 6., geometrically explain Theorem 3

Example Find all points of local maxima and local minima of the function f given by f(x) =x3 – 3x + 3
Solution
We have f(x) =x3 – 3x + 3 or f′(x) =3x2 – 3 = 3(x – 1) ( x + 1) or f′(x) =0 at x = 1 and x = – 1 Thus, x = ± 1 are the only critical points which could possibly be the points of local maxima and/or local minima of f
Let us first examine the point x = 1
Note that for values close to 1 and to the right of 1, f′(x) > 0 and for values close to 1 and to the left of 1, f′(x) < 0
Therefore, by first derivative test, x = 1 is a point of local minima and local minimum value is f(1) = 1
In the case of x = –1, note that f′(x) > 0, for values close to and to the left of –1 and f′(x) < 0, for values close to and to the right of – 1
Therefore, by first derivative test, x = – 1 is a point of local maxima and local maximum value is f(–1) = 5
Values of x Sign of f′′′′′(x) = 3( x – 1) ( x + 1) Close to 1 to the right (say 1.1 etc.) >0 to the left (say 0.9 etc.) <0 Close to –1 to the right (say 0.9 etc.) 0 to the left (say 1.1 etc.) 0- < - > MA THEMA TICS 166 Fig 6.Example Find all the points of local maxima and local minima of the function f given by f(x) =2x3 – 6x2 + 6x +5
Solution
We have f(x) =2x3 – 6x2 + 6x + 5 or f′(x) =6x2 – x + 6 = 6(x – 1)2 or f′(x) =0 at x = 1 Thus, x = 1 is the only critical point of f
We shall now examine this point for local maxima and/or local minima of f
Observe that f′(x) ≥ 0, for all x ∈ R and in particular f′(x) > 0, for values close to 1 and to the left and to the right of 1
Therefore, by first derivative test, the point x = 1 is neither a point of local maxima nor a point of local minima
Hence x = 1 is a point of inflexion
Remark One may note that since f′(x), in Example , never changes its sign on R, graph of f has no turning points and hence no point of local maxima or local minima
We shall now give another test to examine local maxima and local minima of a given function
This test is often easie r to apply than the first derivative test
Theor em 4 (Second Derivative Test) Let f be a function defined on an interval I and c ∈ I
Let f be twice differentiable at c
Then (i)x = c is a point of local maxima if f′(c) = 0 and f″(c) < 0 The value f (c) is local maximum value of f
(ii) x = c is a point of local minima if ( ) 0f c =′ and f″(c) > 0 In this case, f (c) is local minimum value of f
(iii) The test fails if f′(c) = 0 and f″(c) = 0
In this case, we go back to the first derivative test and find whether c is a point of local maxima, local minima or a point of inflexion
ANote As f is twice dif ferentiable at c, we mean second order derivative of f exists at c
Example Find local minimum value of the function f given by f (x) = 3 + |x|, x ∈ R
Solution
Note that the given function is not differentiable at x = 0
So, second derivative test fails
Let us try first derivative test
Note that 0 is a critical point of f
Now to the left of 0, f(x) = 3 – x and so f′(x) = – 1 < 0
Also to APPLICA TION OF DERIV ATIVES 167 the right of 0, f(x) = 3 + x and so f′(x) = 1 > 0
Therefore, by first derivative test, x = 0 is a point of local minima of f and local minimum value of f is f (0) = 3
Example Find local maximum and local minimum values of the function f given by f (x) =3x4 + 4x3 – x2 +
Solution
We have f (x) =3x4 + 4x3 – x2 + or f′(x) =x3 + x2 – x = x (x – 1) ( x + 2) or f′(x) =0 at x = 0, x = 1 and x = – 2
Now f″(x) =x2 + x – = (3x2 + 2x – 2) or′′ = - < ′′ = > ′′ - = >  f f f () () ( ) 0 0 1 0 2 0 Therefore, by second derivative test, x = 0 is a point of local maxima and local maximum value of f at x = 0 is f (0) = while x = 1 and x = – 2 are the points of local minima and local minimum values of f at x = – 1 and – 2 are f (1) = 7 and f (–2) = –, respectively
Example Find all the points of local maxima and local minima of the function f given by f(x) =2x3 – 6x2 + 6x +5
Solution
We have f(x) =2x3 – 6x2 + 6x +5 or2 2( ) 6 6 6( 1) ( ) ( 1)f x x x x f x x′= - + = -′′= - Now f′(x) = 0 gives x =1
Also f″(1) = 0
Therefore, the second derivative test fails in this case
So, we shall go back to the first derivative test
We have already seen (Example ) that, using first derivative test, x =1 is neither a point of local maxima nor a point of local minima and so it is a point of inflexion
Example Find two positive numbers whose sum is and the sum of whose squares is minimum
Solution
Let one of the numbers be x
Then the other number is ( – x)
Let S( x) denote the sum of the squares of these numbers
Then MA THEMA TICS 168 S(x) = x2 + ( – x)2 = 2x2 – x + 225 orS ( ) 4 S ( ) 4x x x′= - ′′= Now S′(x) = 0 gives 2x=
Also S 4  ′′= >
Therefore, by second derivative test, 2x= is the point of local minima of S
Hence the sum of squares of numbers is minimum when the numbers are 2 and 15152 2- =
Remark Proceeding as in Example one may prove that the two positive numbers, whose sum is k and the sum of whose squares is minimum, are and2 2k k
Example Find the shortest distance of the point (0, c) from the parabola y = x2, where 1 2 ≤ c ≤ 5
Solution
Let ( h, k) be any point on the parabola y = x2
Let D be the required distance between ( h, k) and (0, c)
Then 2 2 2 2D ( 0) ( ) ( ) h k c h k c= - + - = + - ..
(1) Since ( h, k) lies on the parabola y = x2, we have k = h2
So (1) gives D ≡D(k) = 2( )k k c+ - or D′(k) = 2( ) 2 ( )k c k k c+ - + - Now D′(k) =0 gives 2 1 2ck-= Observe that when 2 1 2ck-< , then 2( ) 1 0k c- + < , i.e., D( ) 0k′ <
Also when 2 1 2ck-> , then D( ) 0k′ >
So, by first derivative test, D(k) is minimum at 2 1 2ck-=

Example Let AP and BQ be two vertical poles at points A and B, respectively
If AP = m, BQ = m and AB = m, then find the distance of a point R on AB from the point A such that RP2 + RQ2 is minimum
Solution
Let R be a point on AB such that AR = x m
Then RB = ( – x) m (as AB = m)
From Fig 6., we have RP2 =AR2 + AP2 and RQ2 =RB2 + BQ2 Therefore RP2 + RQ2 =AR2 + AP2 + RB2 + BQ2 =x2 + ()2 + ( – x)2 + ()2 =2x2 – x + 1140 Let S ≡ S(x) =RP2 + RQ2 = 2x2 – x + 1140
Therefore S′(x) =4x –
Now S′(x) = 0 gives x =
Also S″(x) = 4 > 0, for all x and so S″() > 0
Therefore, by second derivative test, x = is the point of local minima of S
Thus, the distance of R from A on AB is AR = x = m

Let AP = x cm
Note that ∆APD ~ ∆BQC
Therefore, QB = x cm
Also, by Pythagoras theorem, DP = QC = 2100 x-
Let A be the area of the trapezium
Then A ≡ A(x) =1 2(sum of parallel sides) (height) = ()2 1(2 ) 1002x x+ + - =()2( ) 100x x+ - or A′(x) = ()2 2( 2 )( ) 100 2 100xx x x-+ + - - =2 100 100x x x- - + - Now A′(x) =0 gives 2 x2 + x – 100 = 0, i.e., x = 5 and x = –
Since x represents distance, it can not be negative
So, x =5
Now A″(x) =2 2 2 2( 2 )100 ( 4 ) ( 2 100) 2 100 100xx x x x x x-- - - - - - + - - =3 3 222 300 1000 (100 )x x x- - - (on simplification) or A″(5) =3 3 222(5) 300(5) 1000 2250 300 (100 (5) )- - - -= = < - Thus, area of trapezium is maximum at x = 5 and the area is given by A(5) =2 2(5 ) 100 (5) 3cm+ - = = Example Prove that the radius of the right circular cylinder of greatest curved surface area which can be inscribed in a given cone is half of that of the cone
Solution
Let OC = r be the radius of the cone and OA = h be its height
Let a cylinder with radius OE = x inscribed in the given cone (Fig 6.)
The height QE of the cylinder is given by APPLICA TION OF DERIV ATIVES 171 QE OA =EC OC (since ∆QEC ~ ∆AOC) orQE h =r x r- or QE =( )h r x r- Let S be the curved surface area of the given cylinder
Then S ≡S(x) = 2 ( )xh r x rπ - = ( )hrx xrπ- or2S( ) ( 2 ) 4S( )hx r xr hxrπ′= -- π′′= Now S′(x) = 0 gives 2rx=
Since S″(x) < 0 for all x, S r ′′<
So 2rx= is a point of maxima of S
Hence, the radius of the cylinder of greatest curved surface area which can be inscribed in a given cone is half of that of the cone
6.4.1 Maximum and Minimum V alues of a Function in a Closed Interval Let us consider a function f given by f(x) =x + 2, x ∈ (0, 1) Observe that the function is continuous on (0, 1) and neither has a maximum value nor has a minimum value
Further , we may note that the function even has neither a local maximum value nor a local minimum value
However , if we extend the domain of f to the closed interval [0, 1], then f still may not have a local maximum (minimum) values but it certainly does have maximum value 3 = f(1) and minimum value 2 = f(0)
The maximum value 3 of f at x = 1 is called absolute maximum value ( global maximum or greatest value ) of f on the interval [0, 1]
Similarly , the minimum value 2 of f at x = 0 is called the absolute minimum value ( global minimum or least value ) of f on [0, 1]
Consider the graph given in Fig 6
of a continuous function defined on a closed interval [ a, d]
Observe that the function f has a local minima at x = b and localFig 6
MA THEMA TICS 172 minimum value is f(b)
The function also has a local maxima at x = c and local maximum value is f (c)
Also from the graph, it is evident that f has absolute maximum value f(a) and absolute minimum value f(d)
Further note that the absolute maximum (minimum) value of f is different from local maximum (minimum) value of f
We will now state two results (without proof) regarding absolute maximum and absolute minimum values of a function on a closed interval I
Theorem 5 Let f be a continuous function on an interval I = [ a, b]
Then f has the absolute maximum value and f attains it at least once in I
Also, f has the absolute minimum value and attains it at least once in I
Theorem 6 Let f be a differentiable function on a closed interval I and let c be any interior point of I
Then (i)f′(c) = 0 if f attains its absolute maximum value at c
(ii)f′(c) = 0 if f attains its absolute minimum value at c
In view of the above results, we have the following working rule for finding absolute maximum and/or absolute minimum values of a function in a given closed interval [a, b]
Working Rule Step 1:Find all critical points of f in the interval, i.e., find points x where either ( ) 0f x =′ or f is not differentiable
Step 2: Take the end points of the interval
Step 3:At all these points (listed in Step 1 and 2), calculate the values of f
Step 4:Identify the maximum and minimum values of f out of the values calculated in Step 3
This maximum value will be the absolute maximum (greatest) value of f and the minimum value will be the absolute minimum (least) value of f .Fig 6
APPLICA TION OF DERIV ATIVES 173 Example Find the absolute maximum and minimum values of a function f given by f(x) =2x3 – x2 + x +1 on the interval [1, 5]
Solution
We have f(x) =2x3 – x2 + x + 1 or f′(x) =6x2 – x + = 6(x – 3) ( x – 2) Note that f′(x) = 0 gives x = 2 and x = 3
We shall now evaluate the value of f at these points and at the end points of the interval [1, 5], i.e., at x = 1, x = 2, x = 3 and at x = 5
So f(1) = 2() – () + 3 6(1) + 1 = f(2) = 2() – () + 3 6(2) + 1 = f(3) = 2() – () + 3 6(3) + 1 = f(5) = 2() – () + 3 6(5) + 1 = Thus, we conclude that absolute maximum value of f on [1, 5] is , occurring at x =5, and absolute minimum value of f on [1, 5] is which occurs at x = 1
Example Find absolute maximum and minimum values of a function f given by 4 1 3 3( ) 6 , [ 1,1]f x x x x= - ∈ -
Solution
We have f(x) =4 1 3 312 6x x- or f′(x) =1 3 2 2 3 2(8 1)xx x x-- = Thus, f′(x) = 0 gives 1 8x=
Further note that f′(x) is not defined at x = 0
So the critical points are x = 0 and 1 8x=
Now evaluating the value of f at critical points x = 0, 1 8 and at end points of the interval x = –1 and x = 1, we have f(–1) =4 1 3 312( 1) 6( 1) - - - = f(0) = (0) – 6(0) = 0 MA THEMA TICS 174 1 8f     =4 1 3 1 912 8 4-    - =       f(1) =4 1 3 312(1) 6(1) 6 - = Hence, we conclude that absolute maximum value of f is that occurs at x = –1 and absolute minimum value of f is 9 4- that occurs at 1 8x=
Example An Apache helicopter of enemy is flying along the curve given by y = x2 + 7
A soldier , placed at (3, 7), wants to shoot down the helicopter when it is nearest to him
Find the nearest distance
Solution
For each value of x, the helicopter ’s position is at point ( x, x2 + 7)
Therefore, the distance between the helicopter and the soldier placed at (3,7) is 2 2 2( 3) ( 7 7)x x- + + - , i.e., 2 4( 3)x x- +
Let f(x) =(x – 3)2 + x4 or f′(x) =2(x – 3) + 4 x3 = 2(x – 1) (2 x2 + 2x + 3) Thus, f′(x) = 0 gives x = 1 or 2 x2 + 2x + 3 = 0 for which there are no real roots
Also, there are no end points of the interval to be added to the set for which f′ is zero, i.e., there is only one point, namely , x = 1
The value of f at this point is given by f (1) = (1 – 3)2 + (1)4 = 5
Thus, the distance between the solider and the helicopter is (1) 5f=
Note that 5 is either a maximum value or a minimum value
Since (0)f =2 4(0 3) (0) 3 5- + = > , it follows that 5 is the minimum value of ( )f x
Hence, 5 is the minimum distance between the soldier and the helicopter

Let MS = s metres
Note that ∆MSN ~∆ASB orMS AS =MN AB or AS = 3s (as MN = 2 and AB = 6 (given)) Thus AM = 3s – s = 2 s

Example Find intervals in which the function given by f(x) =4 3 4 363 1110 5 5x x x x- - + + is (a) increasing (b) decreasing
Solution
We have f(x) =4 3 4 363 1110 5 5x x x x- - + + Therefore f′(x) =3 2 3 4 (4 ) (3 ) 3(2 ) 5 5x x x- - + =6( 1)( 2)( 3)5x x x- + - (on simplification)Fig 6
MA THEMA TICS 180 Now f′(x) = 0 gives x = 1, x = – 2, or x = 3
The points x = 1, – 2, and 3 divide the real line into four disjoint intervals namely , (– ∞, – 2), (– 2, 1), (1, 3) and (3, ∞) (Fig 6.)
Consider the interval (– ∞, – 2), i.e., when – ∞ < x < – 2
In this case, we have x – 1 < 0, x + 2 < 0 and x – 3 < 0
(In particular , observe that for x = –3, f′(x) = (x – 1) ( x + 2) ( x – 3) = (– 4) (– 1) (– 6) < 0) Therefore, f′(x) < 0 when – ∞ < x < – 2
Thus, the function f is decreasing in (– ∞, – 2)
Consider the interval (– 2, 1), i.e., when – 2 < x < 1
In this case, we have x – 1 < 0, x + 2 > 0 and x – 3 < 0 (In particular , observe that for x = 0, f′(x) = (x – 1) ( x + 2) ( x – 3) = (–1) (2) (–3) = 6 > 0) So f′(x) > 0 when – 2 < x < 1
Thus, f is increasing in (– 2, 1)
Now consider the interval (1, 3), i.e., when 1 < x < 3
In this case, we have x – 1 > 0, x + 2 > 0 and x – 3 < 0
So, f′(x) < 0 when 1 < x < 3
Thus, f is decreasing in (1, 3)
Finally , consider the interval (3, ∞), i.e., when x > 3
In this case, we have x – 1 > 0, x + 2 > 0 and x – 3 > 0
So f′(x) > 0 when x > 3
Thus, f is increasing in the interval (3, ∞)
Example Show that the function f given by f(x) =tan–1(sin x + cos x), x > 0 is always an increasing function in , π
Solution
We have f(x) =tan–1(sin x + cos x), x > 0 Therefore f′(x) =(cos sin ) 1 (sin cos )x x x x- + +Fig 6

Therefore f′(x) > 0 if cos x – sin x > 0 or f′(x) > 0 if cos x > sin x or cot x > 1 Now cot x > 1 if tan x < 1, i.e., if xπ< < Thus f′(x) > 0 in , π   Hence f is increasing function in 0,4π

Let x metre be the length of a side of the removed squares
Then, the height of the box is x, length is 8 – 2 x and breadth is 3 – 2 x (Fig 6.)
If V( x) is the volume of the box, then Fig 6

Then, we have S(x) =2 5 5100 100x xx x - = -   and C(x) =5005x+ Thus, the profit function P(x) is given by P(x) =2 S( ) C( ) 5 500100 5x xx x x- = - - - i.e
P(x) =2245005 100xx- - or P′(x) = 5 x- Now P′(x) = 0 gives x = 240
Also 1P( )x-′′=
So 1P(240) 050-′′= < Thus, x = 240 is a point of maxima
Hence, the manufacturer can earn maximum profit, if he sells 240 items

PEIRCE .1 Introduction In earlier Classes, we have studied the probability as a measure of uncertainty of events in a random experiment
We discussed the axiomatic approach formulated by Russian Mathematician, A.N
Kolmogorov (1903-1987) and treated probability as a function of outcomes of the experiment
We have also established equivalence between the axiomatic theory and the classical theory of probability in case of equally likely outcomes
On the basis of this relationship, we obtained probabilities of events associated with discrete sample spaces
We have also studied the addition rule of probability
In this chapter , we shall discuss the important concept of conditional probability of an event given that another event has occurred, which will be helpful in understanding the Bayes' theorem, multiplication rule of probability and independence of events
We shall also learn an important concept of random variable and its probability distribution and also the mean and variance of a probability distribution
In the last section of the chapter , we shall study an important discrete probability distribution called Binomial distribution
Throughout this chapter , we shall take up the experiments having equally likely outcomes, unless stated otherwise
.2 Conditional Probability Uptill now in probability , we have discussed the methods of finding the probability of events
If we have two events from the same sample space, does the information about the occurrence of one of the events affect the probability of the other event? Let us try to answer this question by taking up a random experiment in which the outcomes are equally likely to occur
Consider the experiment of tossing three fair coins
The sample space of the experiment is S = {HHH, HHT , HTH, THH, HTT , THT, TTH, TTT}Chapter PROBABILITY Pierre de Fermat (1601-1665) PROBABILITY 407 Since the coins are fair , we can assign the probability 1 8 to each sample point
Let E be the event ‘at least two heads appear ’ and F be the event ‘first coin shows tail’
Then E ={HHH, HHT , HTH, THH} and F ={THH, THT, TTH, TTT} Therefore P(E) = P ({HHH}) + P ({HHT}) + P ({HTH}) + P ({THH}) =1 1 1 1 1 8 8 8 8 2+ + + = (Why ?) and P(F) = P ({THH}) + P ({THT}) + P ({TTH}) + P ({TTT}) =1 1 1 1 1 8 8 8 8 2+ + + = Also E ∩ F ={THH} with P(E ∩ F) = P({THH}) = 1 8 Now , suppose we are given that the first coin shows tail, i.e
F occurs, then what is the probability of occurrence of E? With the information of occurrence of F , we are sure that the cases in which first coin does not result into a tail should not be considered while finding the probability of E
This information reduces our sample space from the set S to its subset F for the event E
In other words, the additional information really amounts to telling us that the situation may be considered as being that of a new random experiment for which the sample space consists of all those outcomes only which are favourable to the occurrence of the event F
Now , the sample point of F which is favourable to event E is THH
Thus, Probability of E considering F as the sample space = 1 4, or Probability of E given that the event F has occurred = 1 4 This probability of the event E is called the conditional pr obability of E given that F has alr eady occur red, and is denoted by P (E|F)
Thus P(E|F) =1 4 Note that the elements of F which favour the event E are the common elements of E and F , i.e
the sample points of E ∩ F
Thus, we can also write the conditional probability of E given that F has occurred as P(E|F) =Numberof elementaryeventsfavourableto E F Numberof elementaryevents which arefavourab le to F∩ =(E F) (F)n n∩ Dividing the numerator and the denominator by total number of elementary events of the sample space, we see that P(E|F) can also be written as P(E|F) =(E F) P(E F) (S) (F) P(F) (S)n n n n∩ ∩= ..
(1) Note that (1) is valid only when P(F) ≠ 0 i.e., F ≠ φ (Why?) Thus, we can define the conditional probability as follows : Definition 1 If E and F are two events associated with the same sample space of a random experiment, the conditional probability of the event E given that F has occurred, i.e
P (E|F) is given by P(E|F) =P(E F) P(F)∩ provided P(F) ≠ 0 .2.1 Properties of conditional probability Let E and F be events of a sample space S of an experiment, then we have Property 1 P(S|F) = P(F|F) = 1 We know that P(S|F) =P(S F) P(F)1 P(F) P(F)∩= = Also P(F|F) =P(F F) P(F)1P(F) P(F)∩= = Thus P(S|F) = P(F|F) = 1 Property 2 If A and B are any two events of a sample space S and F is an event of S such that P(F) ≠ 0, then P((A ∪ B)|F) =P(A|F) + P(B|F) – P((A ∩ B)|F) PROBABILITY 409 In par ticular , if A and B are disjoint events, then P((A∪B)|F) = P(A|F) + P(B|F) We have P((A∪B)|F) =P[(A B) F] P(F)∪ ∩ =P[(A F) (B F)] P(F)∩ ∪ ∩ (by distributive law of union of sets over intersection) =P(A F)+ P(B F) – P(A B F) P(F)∩ ∩ ∩ ∩ =P(A F) P(B F) P[(A B) F] P(F) P(F) P(F)∩ ∩ ∩ ∩+ - =P(A|F) + P(B|F) – P((A∩B)|F) When A and B are disjoint events, then P((A ∩ B)|F) = 0 ⇒ P((A ∪ B)|F) = P(A|F) + P(B|F) Property 3 P(E′|F) = 1 - P(E|F) From Property 1, we know that P(S|F) = 1 ⇒ P(E ∪ E′|F) = 1 since S = E ∪ E′ ⇒ P(E|F) + P (E ′|F) = 1 since E and E ′ are disjoint events Thus, P(E′|F) = 1 - P(E|F) Let us now take up some examples
Example 1
If P(A) = 7 , P(B) = 9 and P(A ∩ B) = 4 , evaluate P(A|B)
Solution
We have 4 P(A B) 4 P(A|B)=9 P(B) 9 ∩= =
Example 2
A family has two children
What is the probability that both the children are boys given that at least one of them is a boy ?
Solution
Let b stand for boy and g for girl
The sample space of the experiment is S ={(b, b), (g, b), (b, g), (g, g)} Let E and F denote the following events : E : ‘both the children are boys ’ F : ‘at least one of the child is a boy ’ Then E ={(b,b)} and F = {( b,b), (g,b), (b,g)} Now E ∩ F ={(b,b)} Thus P(F) =3 4 and P (E ∩ F )= 1 4 Therefore P(E|F) =1 P(E F) 1 4 3 P( F) 3 4∩= =
Example 3

Solution
Let A be the event ‘the number on the card drawn is even’ and B be the event ‘the number on the card drawn is greater than 3’
We have to find P(A|B)
Now , the sample space of th e experiment is S = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, } Then A ={2, 4, 6, 8, }, B = {4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, } and A ∩ B ={4, 6, 8, } Also P(A) =5 7 4, P(B) = and P(A B) ∩ = Then P(A|B) =4 P(A B) 4 7 P(B) 7 ∩= =

Solution
Let E denote the event that a student chosen randomly studies in Class XII and F be the event that the randomly chosen student is a girl
We have to find P (E|F)

Example 6
A die is thrown twice and the sum of the numbers appearing is observed to be 6
What is the conditional probability that the number 4 has appeared at least once?
Solution
Let E be the event that ‘number 4 appears at least once ’ and F be the event that ‘ the sum of the numbers appearing is 6 ’
Then, E ={(4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (5,4), (6,4)} and F ={(1,5), (2,4), (3,3), (4,2), (5,1)} We have P(E) = and P(F) = 5 Also E∩F ={(2,4), (4,2)} Therefore P(E∩F) =2 Hence, the required probability P(E|F) =2 P(E F) 2 5 P(F) 5 ∩= = For the conditional probability discussed above, we have considered the elemen- tary events of the experiment to be equally likely and the corresponding definition of the probability of an event was used
However , the same definition can also be used in the general case where the elementary events of the sample space are not equally likely , the probabilities P(E∩F) and P(F) being calculated accordingly
Let us take up the following example
Example 7
Consider the experiment of tossing a coin
If the coin shows head, toss it again but if it shows tail, then throw a die
Find the conditional probability of the event that ‘the die shows a number greater than 4’ given that ‘there is at least one tail’
Solution
The outcomes of the experiment can be represented in following diagrammatic manner called the ‘tree diagram’
The sample space of the experiment may be described as S = {(H,H), (H,T), (T ,1), (T,2), (T,3), (T,4), (T,5), (T ,6)} where (H, H) denotes that both the tosses result into head and (T , i) denote the first toss result into a tail and the number i appeared on the die for i = 1,2,3,4,5,6
Thus, the probabilities assigned to the 8 elementary events (H, H) , (H, T), (T , 1), (T, 2), (T , 3) (T , 4), (T, 5), (T , 6) are 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1, , , , , , ,4 4 respectively which is clear from the Fig .2.Fig .1 Fig .2 PROBABILITY 413 Let F be the event that ‘there is at least one tail ’ and E be the event ‘the die shows a number greater than 4 ’
Then F ={(H,T), (T ,1), (T ,2), (T ,3), (T ,4), (T ,5), (T ,6)} E ={(T,5), (T ,6)} and E ∩ F = {(T ,5), (T ,6)} Now P(F) = P({(H,T)}) + P ({(T ,1)}) + P ({(T ,2)}) + P ({(T ,3)}) +P ({(T ,4)}) + P({(T ,5)}) + P({(T ,6)}) =1 1 1 1 1 1 1 3 4 4+ + + + + + = and P(E ∩ F) = P ({(T ,5)}) + P ({(T ,6)}) = 1 1 1 6+ = Hence P(E|F) =1 P(E F) 2 6 3 P(F) 9 4∩= = EXERCISE .1 1.Given that E and F are events such that P(E) = 0.6, P(F) = 0.3 and P(E ∩ F) = 0.2, find P(E|F) and P(F|E) 2.Compute P(A|B), if P(B) = 0.5 and P (A ∩ B) = 0

Clearly , the set E ∩ F denotes the event that both E and F have occurred
In other words, E ∩ F denotes the simultaneous occurrence of the events E and F
The event E ∩ F is also written as EF
Very often we need to find the probability of the event EF
For example, in the experiment of drawing two cards one after the other , we may be interested in finding the probability of the event ‘a king and a queen ’
The probability of event EF is obtained by using the conditional probability as obtained below : We know that the conditional probability of event E given that F has occurred is denoted by P(E|F) and is given by P(E|F) =P(E F),P(F) 0P(F)∩≠ From this result, we can write P(E ∩ F) = P(F)
P(E|F) ..
(1) Also, we know that P(F|E) =P(F E),P(E) 0P(E)∩≠ or P(F|E) =P(E F) P(E)∩ (since E ∩ F = F ∩ E) Thus, P(E ∩ F) = P(E)
P(F|E) ...
(2) Combining (1) and (2), we find that P(E ∩ F) = P(E) P(F|E) =P(F) P(E|F) provided P(E) ≠ 0 and P(F) ≠ 0
The above result is known as the multiplication r ule of pr obability
Let us now take up an example
Example 8
An urn contains black and 5 white balls
Two balls are drawn from the urn one after the other without replacement
What is the probability that both drawn balls are black?
Solution
Let E and F denote respectively the events that first and second ball drawn are black
We have to find P(E ∩ F) or P(EF)
Now P(E) = P (black ball in first draw) = Also given that the first ball drawn is black, i.e., event E has occurred, now there are 9 black balls and five white balls left in the urn
Therefore, the probability that the second ball drawn is black, given that the ball in the first draw is black, is nothing but the conditional probability of F given that E has occurred
i.e
P (F|E) =9 By multiplication rule of probability , we have P(E ∩ F) = P(E) P(F|E) = 9 3 7* = Multiplication rule of probability for more than two events If E, F and G are three events of sample space, we have P(E ∩ F ∩ G) = P(E) P(F|E) P(G|(E ∩ F)) = P(E) P(F|E) P(G|EF) Similarly , the multiplication rule of probability can be extended for four or more events
The following example illustrates the extension of multiplication rule of probability for three events
Example 9
Three cards are drawn successively , without replacement from a pack of well shuffled cards
What is the probability that first two cards are kings and the third card drawn is an ace?
Solution
Let K denote the event that the card drawn is king and A be the event that the card drawn is an ace
Clearly , we have to find P (KKA) Now P(K) =4 Also, P(K|K) is the probability of second king with the condition that one king has already been drawn
Now there are three kings in ( - 1) = cards
Therefore P(K|K) =3 Lastly , P(A|KK) is the probability of third drawn card to be an ace, with the condition that two kings have already been drawn
Now there are four aces in left cards
PROBABILITY 417 Therefore P(A|KK) =4 By multiplication law of probability , we have P(KKA) = P(K) P(K|K) P(A|KK) =4 3 4 2 5525* * = .4 Independent Events Consider the experiment of drawing a card from a deck of playing cards, in which the elementary events are assumed to be equally likely
If E and F denote the events 'the card drawn is a spade' and 'the card drawn is an ace' respectively , then P(E) = 1 4 1and P(F) 4 = = = Also E and F is the event ' the card drawn is the ace of spades' so that P(E∩F) =1 Hence P(E|F) =1 P(E F) 1 1 P(F) 4 ∩= = Since P(E) = 1 4= P (E|F), we can say that the occurrence of event F has not affected the probability of occurrence of the event E
We also have P(F|E) =1 P(E F) 1 P(F)1 P(E) 4∩= = = Again, P(F) = 1 = P(F|E) shows that occurrence of event E has not affected the probability of occurrence of the event F
Thus, E and F are two events such that the probability of occurrence of one of them is not af fected by occurrence of the other
Such events are called independent events
Definition 2 Two events E and F are said to be independent, if P(F|E) = P (F) provided P (E) ≠ 0 and P(E|F) = P (E) provided P (F) ≠ 0 Thus, in this definition we need to have P (E) ≠ 0 and P(F) ≠ 0 Now , by the multiplication rule of probability , we have P(E ∩ F) = P(E)
P (F|E) ..
(1) If E and F are independent, then (1) becomes P(E ∩ F) = P(E)
P(F) ..
(2) Thus, using (2), the independence of two events is also defined as follows: Definition 3 Let E and F be two events associated with the same random experiment, then E and F are said to be independent if P(E ∩ F) = P(E)
P (F) Remarks (i)Two events E and F are said to be dependent if they are not independent, i.e
if P(E ∩ F ) ≠ P(E)
P (F) (ii) Sometimes there is a confusion between independent events and mutually exclusive events
Term ‘independent ’ is defined in terms of ‘probability of events ’ whereas mutually exclusive is defined in term of events (subset of sample space)
Moreover , mutually exclusive events never have an outcome common, but independent events, may have common outcome
Clearly , ‘independent ’ and ‘mutually exclusive ’ do not have the same meaning
In other words, two independent events having nonzero probabilities of occurrence can not be mutually exclusive, and conversely , i.e
two mutually exclusive events having nonzero probabilities of occurrence can not be independent
(iii) Two experiments are said to be independent if for every pair of events E and F , where E is associated with the first experiment and F with the second experiment, the probability of the simultaneous occurrence of the events E and F when the two experiments are performed is the product of P(E) and P(F) calculated separately on the basis of two experiments, i.e., P (E ∩ F) = P (E)
P(F) (iv) Three events A, B and C are said to be mutually independent, if P(A ∩ B) = P(A) P(B) P(A ∩ C) = P(A) P(C) P(B ∩ C) = P(B) P(C) and P(A ∩ B ∩ C) = P(A) P(B) P(C) PROBABILITY 419 If at least one of the above is not true for three given events, we say that the events are not independent
Example A die is thrown
If E is the event ‘the number appearing is a multiple of 3’ and F be the event ‘the number appearing is even ’ then find whether E and F are independent ?
Solution
We know that the sample space is S = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} Now E = { 3, 6}, F = { 2, 4, 6} and E ∩ F = {6} Then P(E) = 2 1 3 1 1, P(F) and P(E F)6 3 6 2 6= = = ∩ = Clearly P(E ∩ F) = P(E)
P (F) Hence E and F are independent events
Example 1
1 An unbiased die is thrown twice
Let the event A be ‘odd number on the first throw ’ and B the event ‘odd number on the second throw ’
Check the independence of the events A and B
Solution
If all the elementary events of the experiment are considered to be equally likely , we have P(A) = 1 2= and 1P(B) 2= = Also P(A ∩ B) = P (odd number on both throws) =9 1 4= Now P(A) P(B) =1 1 1 2 2 4* = Clearly P(A ∩ B) = P(A) * P(B) Thus, A and B are independent events Example Three coins are tossed simultaneously
Consider the event E ‘three heads or three tails ’, F ‘at least two heads ’ and G ‘at most two heads ’
Of the pairs (E,F), (E,G) and (F ,G), which are independent? which are dependent?
Solution
The sample space of the experiment is given by S ={HHH, HHT , HTH, THH, HTT , THT , TTH, TTT} Clearly E ={HHH, TTT}, F= {HHH, HHT , HTH, THH} and G ={HHT , HTH, THH, HTT , THT, TTH, TTT} Also E ∩ F ={HHH}, E ∩ G = {TTT}, F ∩ G = {HHT , HTH, THH} Therefore P(E) =2 1 4 1 7, P(F) , P(G)8 4 8 2 8= = = = and P(E∩F) =1 1 3, P(E G) , P(F G)8 8 8∩ = ∩ = Also P(E)
P(F) =1 1 1 1 7 7, P(E) P(G)4 2 8 4 8 * = ⋅ = * = and P(F)
P(G) =1 7 7 2 8 * = Thus P(E ∩ F) = P(E)
P(F) P(E ∩ G) ≠P(E)
P(G) and P(F ∩ G) ≠P (F)
P(G) Hence, the events (E and F) are independent, and the events (E and G) and (F and G) are dependent
Example Prove that if E and F are independent events, then so are the events E and F′
Solution
Since E and F are independent, we have P(E ∩ F) = P(E)
P(F) ....(1) From the venn diagram in Fig .3, it is clear that E ∩ F and E ∩ F′ are mutually exclusive events and also E = (E ∩ F) ∪ (E ∩ F′)
Therefore P(E) = P(E ∩ F) + P(E ∩ F′) or P(E ∩ F′) =P(E) - P(E ∩ F) =P(E) - P(E)
P(F) (by (1)) =P(E) (1 -P(F)) =P(E)
P( F′) Hence, E and F′ are independent(E F ) ’∩ (E F)’∩EFS (E F)∩(E F )’ ’∩ Fig .3 PROBABILITY 421 ANote In a similar manner , it can be shown that if the events E and F are independent, then (a) E′ and F are independent, (b) E′ and F′ are independent Example If A and B are two independent events, then the probability of occurrence of at least one of A and B is given by 1– P(A ′) P(B ′)
Solution
We have P(at least one of A and B) = P(A ∪ B) =P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B) =P(A) + P(B) - P(A) P(B) =P(A) + P(B) [1 -P(A)] =P(A) + P(B)

Bag I contains 2 white and 3 red balls and Bag II contains 4 white and 5 red balls
One ball is drawn at random from one of the bags
We can find the probability of selecting any of the bags (i.e.1 2) or probability of drawing a ball of a particular colour (say white) from a particular bag (say Bag I)
In other words, we can find the probability that the ball drawn is of a particular colour , if we are given the bag from which the ball is drawn
But, can we find the probability that the ball drawn is from a particular bag (say Bag II), if the colour of the ball drawn is given? Here, we have to find the reverse probability of Bag II to be selected when an event occurred after it is known
Famous mathematician, John Bayes' solved the problem of finding reverse probability by using conditional probability
The formula developed by him is known as ‘Bayes theor em’ which was published posthumously in 1763
Before stating and proving the Bayes' theorem, let us first take up a definition and some preliminary results
.5.1 Partition of a sample space A set of events E1, E2, ..., En is said to represent a partition of the sample space S if (a)Ei ∩ Ej = φ, i ≠ j, i, j = 1, 2, 3, ..., n Fig .4(b)E1 ∪ Ε2 ∪ ..
∪ En= S and (c)P(Ei) > 0 for all i = 1, 2, ..., n
In other words, the events E1, E2, ..., En represent a partition of the sample space S if they are pairwise disjoint, exhaustive and have nonzero probabilities
As an example, we see that any nonempty event E and its complement E ′ form a partition of the sample space S since they satisfy E ∩ E′ = φ and E ∪ E′ = S
From the Venn diagram in Fig .3, one can easily observe that if E and F are any two events associated with a sample space S, then the set {E ∩ F′, E ∩ F, E′ ∩ F, E′ ∩ F′} is a partition of the sample space S
It may be mentioned that the partition of a sample space is not unique
There can be several partitions of the same sample space
We shall now prove a theorem known as Theor em of total pr obability
.5.2 Theorem of total probability Let {E1, E2,...,En} be a partition of the sample space S, and suppose that each of the events E1, E2,..., En has nonzero probability of occurrence
Let A be any event associated with S, then P(A) = P(E1) P(A|E1) + P(E2) P(A|E2) + ..
+ P(En) P(A|En) = 1P(E ) P(A|E )n j j j= Proof Given that E1, E2,..., En is a partition of the sample space S (Fig .4)
Therefore, S =E1 ∪ E2 ∪ ..
∪ En ..
(1) and Ei ∩ Ej =φ, i ≠ j, i, j = 1, 2, ..., n Now , we know that for any event A, A =A ∩ S =A ∩ (E1 ∪ E2 ∪ ..
∪ En) =(A ∩ E1) ∪ (A ∩ E2) ∪ ...∪ (A ∩ En) Also A ∩ Ei and A ∩ Ej are respectively the subsets of Ei and Ej
We know that Ei and Ej are disjoint, for ij≠, therefore, A ∩ Ei and A ∩ Ej are also disjoint for all i ≠ j, i, j = 1, 2, ..., n
Thus, P(A) = P [(A ∩ E1) ∪ (A ∩ E2)∪ .....∪ (A ∩ En)] =P (A ∩ E1) + P (A ∩ E2) + ..
+ P (A ∩ En) Now , by multiplication rule of probability , we have P(A ∩ Ei) =P(Ei) P(A|Ei) as P (Ei) ≠ 0∀i = 1,2,..., n PROBABILITY 425 Therefore, P (A) = P (E1) P (A|E1) + P (E2) P (A|E2) + ..
+ P (En)P(A|En) or P(A) = 1P(E ) P(A|E )n j j j= Example A person has undertaken a construction job
The probabilities are 0
that there will be strike, 0
that the construction job will be completed on time if there is no strike, and 0
that the construction job will be completed on time if there is a strike
Determine the probability that the construction job will be completed on time
Solution
Let A be the event that the construction job will be completed on time, and B be the event that there will be a strike
We have to find P(A)
We have P(B) = 0., P(no strike) = P(B ′) = 1 - P(B) = 1 - 0
= 0
P(A|B) = 0., P(A|B ′) = 0
Since events B and B ′ form a partition of the sample space S, therefore, by theorem on total probability , we have P(A) = P(B) P(A|B) + P(B ′) P(A|B ′) = 0
* 0
+ 0
* 0.8 = 0.208 + 0
= 0.488 Thus, the probability that the construction job will be completed in time is 0.488
We shall now state and prove the Bayes' theorem
Bayes’ Theorem If E1, E2 ,..., En are n non empty events which constitute a partition of sample space S, i.e
E1, E2 ,..., En are pairwise disjoint and E1∪ E2∪ ..
∪ En = S and A is any event of nonzero probability , then P(Ei|A) = 1P(E ) P(A|E ) P(E ) P(A|E )i i n j j j= for any i = 1, 2, 3, ..., n Proof By formula of conditional probability , we know that P(Ei|A) =P(A E ) P(A)i∩ =P(E )P(A|E ) P(A)i i (by multiplication rule of probability) = 1P(E ) P(A|E ) P(E )P(A|E )i i n j j j= (by the result of theorem of total probability) Remark The following terminology is generally used when Bayes' theorem is applied
The events E1, E2, ..., En are called hypotheses
The probability P(Ei) is called the priori pr obability of the hypothesis Ei The conditional probability P(Ei |A) is called a posteriori pr obability of the hypothesis Ei
Bayes' theorem is also called the formula for the probability of "causes"
Since the Ei's are a partition of the sample space S, one and only one of the events Ei occurs (i.e
one of the events Ei must occur and only one can occur)
Hence, the above formula gives us the probability of a particular Ei (i.e
a "Cause"), given that the event A has occurred
The Bayes' theorem has its applications in variety of situations, few of which are illustrated in following examples
Example Bag I contains 3 red and 4 black balls while another Bag II contains 5 red and 6 black balls
One ball is drawn at random from one of the bags and it is found to be red
Find the probability that it was drawn from Bag II
Solution
Let E1 be the event of choosing the bag I, E2 the event of choosing the bag II and A be the event of drawing a red ba ll
Then P(E1) =P(E2) = 1 2 Also P(A|E1) =P(drawing a red ball from Bag I) = 3 7 and P(A|E2) =P(drawing a red ball from Bag II) = 5 Now , the probability of drawing a ball from Bag II, being given that it is red, is P(E2|A) By using Bayes' theorem, we have P(E2|A) =2 2 1 1 2 2P(E )P(A|E ) P(E )P(A|E )+ P(E )P(A|E ) = 1 5 2 1 3 1 5 2 7 2 * = * + * Example Given three identical boxes I, II and III, each containing two coins
In box I, both coins are gold coins, in box II, both are silver coins and in the box III, there is one gold and one silver coin
A person chooses a box at random and takes out a coin
If the coin is of gold, what is the probability that the other coin in the box is also of gold? PROBABILITY 427
Solution
Let E1, E2 and E3 be the events that boxes I, II and III are chosen, respectively
Then P(E1) =P(E2) = P(E3) = 1 3 Also, let A be the event that ‘the coin drawn is of gold ’ Then P(A|E1) =P(a gold coin from bag I) = 2 2 = 1 P(A|E2) =P(a gold coin from bag II) = 0 P(A|E3) =P(a gold coin from bag III) = 1 2 Now, the probability that the other coin in the box is of gold =the probability that gold coin is drawn from the box I
=P(E1|A) By Bayes' theorem, we know that P(E1|A) =1 1 1 1 2 2 3 3P(E )P(A|E ) P(E )P(A|E )+ P(E )P(A|E )+ P(E )P(A|E ) =112 3 1 1 1 1 3 3 2* = * + * + * Example Suppose that the reliability of a HIV test is specified as follows: Of people having HIV , % of the test detect the disease but % go undetected
Of people free of HIV , % of the test are judged HIV–ive but 1% are diagnosed as showing HIV+ive
From a lar ge population of which only 0.1% have HIV , one person is selected at random, given the HIV test, and the pathologist reports him/her as HIV+ive
What is the probability that the person actually has HIV?
Solution
Let E denote the event that the person selected is actually having HIV and A the event that the person's HIV test is diagnosed as +ive
We need to find P(E|A)
Also E ′ denotes the event that the person selected is actually not having HIV
Clearly , {E, E ′} is a partition of the sample space of all people in the population
We are given that P(E) = 0.1% 0..001100= = P(E′) =1 – P(E) = 0.999 P(A|E) = P(Person tested as HIV+ive given that he/she is actually having HIV) =% 900.9100= = and P(A|E ′) =P(Person tested as HIV +ive given that he/she is actually not having HIV) =1% = 1 100= 0

Thus, the probability that a person selected at random is actually having HIV given that he/she is tested HIV+ive is 0.083
Example In a factory which manufactures bolts, machines A, B and C manufacture respectively %, % and % of the bolts
Of their outputs, 5, 4 and 2 percent are respectively defective bolts
A bolt is drawn at random from the product and is found to be defective
What is the probability that it is manufactured by the machine B?
Solution
Let events B1, B2, B3 be the following : B1 : the bolt is manufactured by machine A B2 : the bolt is manufactured by machine B B3 : the bolt is manufactured by machine C Clearly , B1, B2, B3 are mutually exclusive and exhaustive events and hence, they represent a partition of the sample space
Let the event E be ‘the bolt is defective ’
The event E occurs with B1 or with B2 or with B3
Given that, P(B1) =% = 0., P (B2) = 0
and P(B3) = 0
Again P(E|B1) =Probability that the bolt drawn is defective given that it is manu- factured by machine A = 5% = 0
Similarly ,P(E|B2) =0., P(E|B3) = 0.
PROBABILITY 429 Hence, by Bayes' Theorem, we have P(B2|E) =2 2 1 1 2 2 3 3P(B )P(E|B ) P(B )P(E|B )+ P(B )P(E|B )+P(B )P(E|B ) =0

From the past experience, it is known that the probabilities that he will come by train, bus, scooter or by other means of transport are respectively 3 1 1 2, , and 5 5
The probabilities that he will be late are 1 1 1, , and4 3 , if he comes by train, bus and scooter respectively , but if he comes by other means of transport, then he will not be late
When he arrives, he is late
What is the probability that he comes by train?
Solution
Let E be the event that the doctor visits the patient late and let T1, T2, T3, T4be the events that the doctor comes by train, bus, scooter , and other means of transport respectively
Then P(T1) = 2 3 1 1 2, P(T ) ,P(T ) and P(T ) 5 5= = = (given) P(E|T1) =Probability that the doctor arriving late comes by train = 1 4 Similarly , P(E|T2) = 1 3, P(E|T3) = 1 and P(E|T4) = 0, since he is not late if he comes by other means of transport
Therefore, by Bayes' Theorem, we have P(T1|E) = Probability that the doctor arriving late comes by train =1 1 1 1 2 2 3 3 4 4P(T )P(E|T ) P(T )P(E|T )+ P(T )P(E|T )+ P(T )P(E|T )+ P(T )P(E |T ) =3 1 4 3 1 1 1 1 1 2010 4 5 3 5* * + * + * + * = 3 120 1 2* = Hence, the required probability is 1 2
Example A man is known to speak truth 3 out of 4 times
He throws a die and reports that it is a six
Find the probability that it is actually a six
Solution
Let E be the event that the man reports that six occurs in the throwing of the die and let S1 be the event that six occurs and S2 be the event that six does not occur
Then P(S1) =Probability that six occurs = 1 6 P(S2) =Probability that six does not occur = 5 6 P(E|S1) =Probability that the man reports that six occurs when six has actually occurred on the die =Probability that the man speaks the truth = 3 4 P(E|S2) =Probability that the man reports that six occurs when six has not actually occurred on the die =Probability that the man does not speak the truth 3 114 4= - = Thus, by Bayes' theorem, we get P(S1|E) = Probability that the report of the man that six has occurred is actually a six =1 1 1 1 2 2P(S )P(E |S ) P(S )P(E|S )+P(S )P(E|S ) =1 3 1 3 6 4 1 3 5 1 8 8 8 6 4 6 4* = * = * + * Hence, the required probability is 3
8 Remark A random variable is a real valued function whose domain is the sample space of a random experiment
For example, let us consider the experiment of tossing a coin two times in succession
The sample space of the experiment is S = {HH, HT , TH, TT}
PROBABILITY 431 If X denotes the number of heads obtained, then X is a random variable and for each outcome, its value is as given below : X(HH) = 2, X (HT) = 1, X (TH) = 1, X (TT) = 0
More than one random variables can be defined on the same sample space
For example, let Y denote the number of heads minus the number of tails for each outcome of the above sample space S
Then Y(HH) = 2, Y (HT) = 0, Y (TH) = 0, Y (TT) = – 2
Thus, X and Y are two dif ferent random variables defined on the same sample space S

Solution
Let A, E1, E2, E3 and E4 be the events as defined below : A : a black ball is selected E1 : box I is selected E2 : box II is selected E3 : box III is selected E4 : box IV is selected Since the boxes are chosen at random, Therefore P(E1) =P(E2) = P(E3) = P(E4) = 1 4 Also P(A|E1) =3 , P(A|E2) = 2 8, P(A|E3) = 1 7 and P(A|E4) = 4 P(box III is selected, given that the drawn ball is black) = P(E3|A)

Thus, P(S) =1 5, P(F)6 6= P(A wins in the first throw) = P(S) = 1 6 A gets the third throw , when the first throw by A and second throw by B result into failures

A treatise on gambling named liber de Ludo Alcae , by Geronimo Carden (1501-1576) was published posthumously in 1663
In this treatise, he gives the number of favourable cases for each event when two dice are thrown
Galileo (1564-1642) gave casual remarks concerning the correct evaluation of chance in a game of three dice
Galileo analysed that when three dice are thrown, the sum of the number that appear is more likely to be than the sum 9, because the number of cases favourable to are more than the number of cases for the appearance of number 9
Apart from these early contributions, it is generally acknowledged that the true origin of the science of probability lies in the correspondence between two great men of the seventeenth century , Pascal (1623-1662) and Pierre de Fermat (1601-1665)
A French gambler , Chevalier de Metre asked Pascal to explain some seeming contradiction between his theoretical reasoning and the observation gathered from gambling
In a series of letters written around 1654, Pascal and Fermat laid the first foundation of science of probability
Pascal solved the problem in algebraic manner while Fermat used the method of combinations
Great Dutch Scientist, Huygens (1629-1695), became acquainted with the content of the correspondence between Pascal and Fermat and published a first book on probability , "De Ratiociniis in Ludo Aleae " containing solution of many interesting rather than difficult problems on probability in games of chances
The next great work on probability theory is by Jacob Bernoulli (1654-1705), in the form of a great book, " Ars Conjectendi " published posthumously in 1713 by his nephew , Nicholes Bernoulli
To him is due the discovery of one of the most important probability distribution known as Binomial distribution
The next remarkable work on probability lies in 1993

Kolmogorov (1903-1987) is credited with the axiomatic theory of probability
His book, ‘Foundations of probability’ published in 1933, introduces probability as a set function and is considered a ‘classic!’
—vvvvv— THREE DIMENSIONAL GEOMETR Y 377 vThe moving power of mathematical invention is not reasoning but imagination
– A .DEMORGAN .1 Intr oduction In Class XI, while studying Analytical Geometry in two dimensions, and the introduction to three dimensional geometry , we confined to the Cartesian methods only
In the previous chapter of this book, we have studied some basic concepts of vectors
We will now use vector algebra to three dimensional geometry
The purpose of this approach to 3-dimensional geometry is that it makes the study simple and elegant*
In this chapter , we shall study the direction cosines and direction ratios of a line joining two points and also discuss about the equations of lines and planes in space under different conditions, angle between two lines, two planes, a line and a plane, shortest distance between two skew lines and distance of a point from a plane
Most of the above results are obtained in vector form
Nevertheless, we shall also translate these results in the Cartesian form which, at times, presents a more clear geometric and analytic picture of the situation
.2 Dir ection Cosines and Dir ection Ratios of a Line From Chapter , recall that if a directed line L passing through the origin makes angles α, β and γ with x, y and z-axes, respectively , called direction angles, then cosine of these angles, namely , cos α, cos β and cos γ are called direction cosines of the directed line L
If we reverse the direction of L, then the direction angles are replaced by their supplements, i.e., , and
Thus, the signs of the direction cosines are reversed.Chapter THREE DIMENSIONAL GEOMETR Y *For various activities in three dimensional geometry , one may refer to the Book “A Hand Book for designing Mathematics Laboratory in Schools” , NCER T, 2005Leonhard Euler (1707-1783) MA THEMA TICS 378 Note that a given line in space can be extended in two opposite directions and so it has two sets of direction cosines
In order to have a unique set of direction cosines for a given line in space, we must take the given line as a directed line
These unique direction cosines are denoted by l, m and n
Remark If the given line in space does not pass through the origin, then, in order to find its direction cosines, we draw a line through the origin and parallel to the given line
Now take one of the directed lines from the origin and find its direction cosines as two parallel line have same set of direction cosines
Any three numbers which are proportional to the direction cosines of a line are called the direction ratios of the line
If l, m, n are direction cosines and a, b, c are direction ratios of a line, then a = λl, b=λm and c = λn, for any nonzero λ ∈ R
ANote Some authors also call direction ratios as direction numbers
Let a, b, c be direction ratios of a line and let l, m and n be the direction cosines (d.c’s) of the line
Then l a = m b =nkc= (say), k being a constant
Therefore l = ak, m =bk, n = ck ..
(1) But l2 + m2 + n2 =1 Therefore k2 (a2 + b2 + c2) =1 or k =2 2 a b c± + +Fig 1 1.1 THREE DIMENSIONAL GEOMETR Y 379 Hence, from (1), the d.c.’s of the line are 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2, ,a b cl m n a b c a b c a b c= ± = ± = ± + + + + + + where, depending on the desired sign of k, either a positive or a negative sign is to be taken for l, m and n
For any line, if a, b, c are direction ratios of a line, then ka, kb, kc; k ≠ 0 is also a set of direction ratios
So, any two sets of direction ratios of a line are also proportional
Also, for any line there are infinitely many sets of direction ratios
.2.1 Direction cosines of a line passing through two point s Since one and only one line passes through two given points, we can determine the direction cosines of a line passing through the given points P( x1, y1, z1) and Q( x2, y2, z2) as follows (Fig 1 1.2 (a))
Fig 1 1.2 Let l, m, n be the direction cosines of the line PQ and let it makes angles α, β and γ with the x, y and z-axis, respectively
Draw perpendiculars from P and Q to XY -plane to meet at R and S
Draw a perpendicular from P to QS to meet at N
Now , in right angle triangle PNQ, ∠PQN= γ (Fig 1 1.2 (b)
Therefore, cosγ =2 1 NQ PQ PQz z-= Similarly cosα =2 1 2 1and cosPQ PQx x y y- -β= Hence, the direction cosines of the line segment joining the points P( x1, y1, z1) and Q(x2, y2, z2) are MA THEMA TICS 380 2 1 PQx x-, 2 1 PQy y-, 2 1 PQz z- where PQ = ( )2 2 2 2 1 2 1 2 1( ) ( )x x y y z z- + - + - ANote The direction ratios of the line segment joining P( x1, y1, z1) and Q( x2, y2, z2) may be taken as x2 – x1, y2 – y1, z2 – z1 or x1 – x2, y1 – y2, z1 – z2
Example 1
If a line makes angle °, ° and ° with the positive direction of x, y and z-axis respectively , find its direction cosines
Solution
Let the d.c.'s of the lines be l , m, n
Then l = cos 900 = 0, m = cos 600 = 1 2, n = cos 300 =

We know the direction cosines of the line passing through two points P(x1, y1, z1) and Q( x2, y2, z2) are given by 2 1 2 1 2 1 , , PQ PQ PQx x y y z z- - - where PQ = ( )2 1 1 1 2 ) ( ) ( z z y y x x- + - + - Here P is (– 2, 4, – 5) and Q is (1, 2, 3)
So PQ =2 2 2(1 ( 2)) (2 4) (3 ( 5))- - + - + - - = Thus , the direction cosines of the line joining two points is 3 2 8, , - THREE DIMENSIONAL GEOMETR Y 381
Example 4
Find the direction cosines of x, y and z-axis
Solution
The x-axis makes angles 0°, ° and ° respectively with x, y and z-axis
Therefore, the direction cosines of x-axis are cos 0°, cos °, cos ° i.e., 1,0,0
Similarly , direction cosines of y-axis and z-axis are 0, 1, 0 and 0, 0, 1 respectively
Example 5
Show that the points A (2, 3, – 4), B (1, – 2, 3) and C (3, 8, – 1 1) are collinear
Solution
Direction ratios of line joining A and B are 1 – 2, – 2 – 3, 3 + 4 i.e., – 1, – 5, 7
The direction ratios of line joining B and C are 3 –1, 8 + 2, – 1 1 – 3, i.e., 2, , –
It is clear that direction ratios of AB and BC are proportional, hence, AB is parallel to BC
But point B is common to both AB and BC
Therefore, A, B, C are collinear points

.3 Equation of a Line in Space We have studied equation of lines in two dimensions in Class XI, we shall now study the vector and cartesian equations of a line in space
A line is uniquely determined if (i)it passes through a given point and has given direction, or (ii)it passes through two given points
.3.1 Equation of a line through a given point and parallel to given vector Let be the position vector of the given point A with respect to the origin O of the rectangular coordinate system
Let l be the line which passes through the point A and is parallel to a given vector
Let be the position vector of an arbitrary point P on the line (Fig 1 1.3)
MA THEMA TICS 382 Then AP/combarrowextender/combarrowextender/combarrowextender/arrowrightnosp is parallel to the vector , i.e., AP/combarrowextender/combarrowextender/combarrowextender/arrowrightnosp = λ , where λ is some real number
But AP/combarrowextender/combarrowextender/combarrowextender/arrowrightnosp =OP–OA/combarrowextender/combarrowextender/combarrowextender/arrowrightnosp /combarrowextender/combarrowextender/combarrowextender/arrowrightnosp i.e
λ = -/arrowrightnosp /arrowrightnospr a Conversely , for each value of the parameter λ, this equation gives the position vector of a point P on the line
Hence, the vector equation of the line is given by =»/arrowrightnosp/arrowrightnospa+ b ..
(1) Remark If ˆˆ ˆ= + +/arrowrightnosp b ai bj ck , then a, b, c are direction ratios of the line and conversely , if a, b, c are direction ratios of a line, then ˆˆ ˆ= + +/arrowrightnosp b ai bj ck will be the parallel to the line
Here, b should not be confused with | |
Derivation of cartesian form from vector form Let the coordinates of the given point A be (x1, y1, z1) and the direction ratios of the line be a, b, c
Consider the coordinates of any point P be (x, y, z)
Then ˆ ˆ ˆr xi yj zk= + +/arrowrightnosp; 1 1 1ˆ ˆ ˆa x i y j z k= + +/arrowrightnosp and ˆˆ ˆ = + +/arrowrightnosp b ai b j ck Substituting these values in (1) and equating the coefficients of ˆ ˆ,i j and kˆ, we get x = x1 + λa; y =y1 + λ b; z = z1+ λc ..
(2) These are parametric equations of the line
Eliminating the parameter λ from (2), we get 1 x – x a =1 1 y – y z – z=b c..
(3) This is the Cartesian equation of the line
ANote If l, m, n are the direction cosines of the line, the equation of the line is 1 x – x l =1 1 y – y z – z=m n
Example 6

Consider the directed lines OP and OQ as given in Fig 1 1.6
Let θ be the acute angle between OP and OQ
Now recall that the directed line segments OP and OQ are vectors with components a1, b1, c1 and a2, b2, c2, respectively

If instead of direction ratios for the lines L1 and L2, direction cosines, namely , l1, m1, n1 for L1 and l2, m2, n2 for L2 are given, then (1) and (2) takes the following form: cos θ =|l1 l2 + m1m2 + n1n2| (as 2 2 2 1 1 1 1 l m n+ + =2 2 2 2 2 2l m n= + + ) ..

.5 Shortest Distance between Two Lines If two lines in space intersect at a point, then the shortest distance between them is zero
Also, if two lines in space are parallel, then the shortest distance between them will be the perpendicular distance, i.e
the length of the perpendicular drawn from a point on one line onto the other line
Further , in a space, there are lines which are neither intersecting nor parallel
In fact, such pair of lines are non coplanar and are called skew lines
For example, let us consider a room of size 1, 3, 2 units along x, y and z-axes respectively Fig 1 1.5.Fig 1 1.5 MA THEMA TICS 386 l2 ST Q Pl1The line GE that goes diagonally across the ceiling and the line DB passes through one corner of the ceiling directly above A and goes diagonally down the wall
These lines are skew because they are not parallel and also never meet
By the shortest distance between two lines we mean the join of a point in one line with one point on the other line so that the length of the segment so obtained is the smallest
For skew lines, the line of the shortest distance will be perpendicular to both the lines
.5.1 Dist ance between two skew lines We now determine the shortest distance between two skew lines in the following way: Let l1 and l2 be two skew lines with equations (Fig
1 1.6) =1 1+ λ/arrowrightnosp/arrowrightnospab ..
(1) and =2 2+ µ/arrowrightnosp/arrowrightnospa b ..
(2) Take any point S on l1 with position vector 1a/arrowrightnosp and T on l2, with position vector 2a/arrowrightnosp
Then the magnitude of the shortest distance vector will be equal to that of the projection of ST along the direction of the line of shortest dis tance (See .6.2)
If PQ/combarrowextender/combarrowextender/combarrowextender/arrowrightnosp is the shortest distance vector between l1 and l2 , then it being perpendicular to both 1/arrowrightnosp b and 2/arrowrightnosp b, the unit vector nˆ along PQ/combarrowextender/combarrowextender/combarrowextender/arrowrightnosp would therefore be ˆn =1 2 1 2| |* */arrowrightnosp /arrowrightnosp /arrowrightnosp /arrowrightnospb b b b ..
(3) Then PQ/combarrowextender/combarrowextender/combarrowextender/arrowrightnosp =d nˆ where, d is the magnitude of the shortest distance vector
Let θ be the angle between ST/combarrowextender/combarrowextender/arrowrightnosp and PQ/combarrowextender/combarrowextender/combarrowextender/arrowrightnosp

Let the lines be given by ..
(1) and ..
(2) where, 1a/arrowrightnospis the position vector of a point S on l1 and 2a/arrowrightnosp is the position vector of a point T on l2 Fig 1 1.7
As l1, l2 are coplanar , if the foot of the perpendicular from T on the line l1 is P, then the distance between the lines l1 and l2 = |TP|
Let θ be the angle between the vectors ST/combarrowextender/combarrowextender/arrowrightnosp and
Then ST* =/combarrowextender/combarrowextender/arrowrightnosp/arrowrightnosp b ˆ..
(3) where nˆ is the unit vector perpendicular to the plane of the lines l1 and l2
But ST/combarrowextender/combarrowextender/arrowrightnosp =2 1-/arrowrightnosp /arrowrightnospa aFig 1 1.7 MA THEMA TICS 388 Therefore, from (3), we get 2 1( )* -/arrowrightnosp/arrowrightnosp /arrowrightnospb a a =ˆ|PT/arrowrightnosp b n (since PT = ST sin θ) i.e.,2 1| ( )|* -/arrowrightnosp/arrowrightnosp /arrowrightnospb a a =| |PT 1 ⋅/arrowrightnosp b (as | |ˆn = 1) Hence, the distance between the given parallel lines is d =

POL YA .1 Introduction In earlier classes, we have discussed systems of linear equations and their applications in day to day problems
In Class XI, we have studied linear inequalities and systems of linear inequalities in two variables and their solutions by graphical method
Many applications in mathematics involve systems of inequalities/equations
In this chapter , we shall apply the systems of linear inequalities/equations to solve some real life problems of the type as given below: A furniture dealer deals in only two items–tables and chairs
He has Rs ,000 to invest and has storage space of at most pieces
A table costs Rs 2500 and a chair Rs 500
He estimates that from the sale of one table, he can make a profit of Rs 250 and that from the sale of one chair a profit of Rs
He wants to know how many tables and chairs he should buy from the available money so as to maximise his total profit, assuming that he can sell all the items which he buys
Such type of problems which seek to maximise (or , minimise) profit (or , cost) form a general class of problems called optimisation problems
Thus, an optimisation problem may involve finding maximum profit, minimum cost, or minimum use of resources etc
A special but a very important class of optimisation problems is linear programming problem
The above stated optimisation problem is an example of linear programming problem
Linear programming problems are of much interest because of their wide applicability in industry , commerce, management science etc
In this chapter , we shall study some linear programming problems and their solutions by graphical method only , though there are many other methods also to solve such problems.Chapter LINEAR PROGRAMMING L
Kantorovich LINEAR PROGRAMMING 395 .2 Linear Programming Problem and its Mathematical Formulation We begin our discussion with the above example of furniture dealer which will further lead to a mathematical formulation of the problem in two variables
In this example, we observe (i)The dealer can invest his money in buying tables or chairs or combination thereof
Further he would earn different profits by following different investment strategies
(ii) There are certain overriding conditions or constraints viz., his investment is limited to a maximum of Rs ,000 and so is his storage space which is for a maximum of pieces
Suppose he decides to buy tables only and no chairs, so he can buy 50000 / 2500, i.e., tables
His profit in this case will be Rs (250 * ), i.e., Rs 5000
Suppose he chooses to buy chairs only and no tables
With his capital of Rs ,000, he can buy 50000 / 500, i.e
100 chairs
But he can store only pieces
Therefore, he is forced to buy only chairs which will give him a total profit of Rs ( * ), i.e., Rs 4500
There are many other possibilities, for instance, he may choose to buy tables and chairs, as he can store only pieces
Total profit in this case would be Rs ( * 250 + * ), i.e., Rs 6250 and so on
We, thus, find that the dealer can invest his money in dif ferent ways and he would earn different profits by following different investment strategies
Now the problem is : How should he invest his money in order to get maximum profit? To answer this question, let us try to formulate the problem mathematically
.2.1 Mathematical formulation of the problem Let x be the number of tables and y be the number of chairs that the dealer buys
Obviously , x and y must be non-negative, i.e., 0 ..
(1)(Non-negative constraints)..
(2) 0x y≥ ≥ The dealer is constrained by the maximum amount he can invest (Here it is Rs ,000) and by the maximum number of items he can store (Here it is )
Stated mathematically , 2500 x + 500 y ≤50000 (investment constraint) or 5x + y ≤100 ..
(3) and x + y ≤ (storage constraint) ..
(4) The dealer wants to invest in such a way so as to maximise his profit, say , Z which stated as a function of x and y is given by Z = 250 x + y (called objective function ) ..
(5) Mathematically , the given problems now reduces to: Maximise Z = 250 x + y subject to the constraints: 5x + y ≤100 x + y ≤ x ≥ 0, y ≥0 So, we have to maximise the linear function Z subject to certain conditions determined by a set of linear inequalities with variables as non-negative
There are also some other problems where we have to minimise a linear function subject to certain conditions determined by a set of linear inequalities with variables as non-negative
Such problems are called Linear Programming Problems
Thus, a Linear Programming Problem is one that is concerned with finding the optimal value (maximum or minimum value) of a linear function (called objective function ) of several variables (say x and y), subject to the conditions that the variables are non-negative and satisfy a set of linear inequalities (called linear constraints)
The term linear implies that all the mathematical relations used in the problem are linear relations while the term programming refers to the method of determining a particular programme or plan of action
Before we proceed further , we now formally define some terms (which have been used above) which we shall be using in the linear programming problems: Objective function Linear function Z = ax + by, where a, b are constants, which has to be maximised or minimized is called a linear objective function
In the above example, Z = 250 x + y is a linear objective function
Variables x and y are called decision variables
Constraints The linear inequalities or equations or restrictions on the variables of a linear programming problem are called constraints
The conditions x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0 are called non-negative restrictions
In the above example, the set of inequalities (1) to (4) are constraints
Optimisation pr oblem A problem which seeks to maximise or minimise a linear function (say of two variables x and y) subject to certain constraints as determined by a set of linear inequalities is called an optimisation problem
Linear programming problems are sp ecial type of optimisation problems
The above problem of investing a LINEAR PROGRAMMING 397 given sum by the dealer in purchasing chairs and tables is an example of an optimisation problem as well as of a linear programming problem
We will now discuss how to find solutions to a linear programming problem
In this chapter , we will be concerned only with the graphical method
.2.2 Graphical method of solving linear programming problems In Class XI, we have learnt how to graph a system of linear inequalities involving two variables x and y and to find its solutions graphically
Let us refer to the problem of investment in tables and chairs discussed in Section .2
We will now solve this problem graphically
Let us graph the constraints stated as linear inequalities: 5x + y ≤100 ..
(1) x + y ≤ ..
(2) x ≥0 ..
(3) y ≥0 ..
(4) The graph of this system (shaded region) consists of the points common to all half planes determined by the inequalities (1) to (4) (Fig .1)
Each point in this region represents a feasible choice open to the dealer for investing in tables and chairs
The region, therefore, is called the feasible region for the problem
Every point of this region is called a feasible solution to the pro blem
Thus, we have, Feasible region The common region determined by all the constraints including non-negative c onstraints x, y ≥ 0 of a linear programming problem is called the feasible region (or solution region) for the problem
In Fig .1, the region OABC (shaded) is the feasible region for the problem
The region other than feasible region is called an infeasible region
Feasible solutions Points within and on the boundary of the feasible region represent feasible solutions of the constraints
In Fig .1, every point within and on the boundary of the feasible region OABC represents feasible solution to the problem
For example, the point (, ) is a feasible solution of the problem and so are the points (0, ), (, 0) etc
Any point outside the feasible region is called an infeasible solution
For example, the point (, ) is an infeasible solution of the problem.Fig .1 Optimal (feasible) solution : Any point in the feasible region that gives the optimal value (maximum or minimum) of the objective function is called an optimal solution
Now, we see that every point in the feasible region OABC satisfies all the constraints as given in (1) to (4), and since there are infinitely many points , it is not evident how we should go about finding a point that gives a maximum value of the objective function Z = 250 x + y
To handle this situation, we use the following theorems which are fundamental in solving linear programming problems
The proofs of these theorems are beyond the scope of the book
Theorem 1 Let R be the feasible region (convex polygon) for a linear programming problem and let Z = ax + by be the objective function
When Z has an optimal value (maximum or minimum), where the variables x and y are subject to constraints described by linear inequalities, this optimal value must occur at a corner point* (vertex) of the feasible region
Theorem 2 Let R be the feasible region for a linear programming problem, and let Z = ax + by be the objective function
If R is bounded** , then the objective function Z has both a maximum and a minimum value on R and each of these occurs at a corner point (vertex) of R
Remark If R is unbounded , then a maximum or a minimum value of the objective function may not exist
However , if it exists, it must occur at a corner point of R
(By Theorem 1)
In the above example, the corner points (vertices) of the bounded (feasible) region are: O, A, B and C and it is easy to find their coordinates as (0, 0), (, 0), (, ) and (0, ) respectively
Let us now compute the values of Z at these points
We have * A corn er point of a feasible region is a point in the region which is the intersection of two boundary lines
** A feasible region of a system of linear inequalities is said to be bounded if it can be enclosed within a circle
Otherwise, it is called unbounded
Unbounded means that the feasible region does extend indefinitely in any direction.Vertex of the Corresponding value Feasible Region of Z (in Rs) O (0,0) 0 C (0,) 4500 B (,) 6250 A (,0) 5000Maximum ← LINEAR PROGRAMMING 399 We observe that the maximum profit to the dealer results from the investment strategy (, ), i.e

This method of solving linear programming problem is referred as Corner Point Method
The method comprises of the following steps: 1.Find the feasible region of the linear programming problem and determine its corner points (vertices) either by inspection or by solving the two equations of the lines intersecting at that point
2.Evaluate the objective function Z = ax + by at each corner point
Let M and m, respectively denote the largest and smallest values of these points
3.(i)When the feasible region is bounded , M and m are the maximum and minimum values of Z
(ii)In case, the feasible region is unbounded , we have: 4.(a)M is the maximum value of Z, if the open half plane determined by ax + by > M has no point in common with the feasible region
Otherwise, Z has no maximum value
(b)Similarly , m is the minimum value of Z, if the open half plane determined by ax + by < m has no point in common with the feasible region
Otherwise, Z has no minimum value
We will now illustrate these steps of Corner Point Method by considering some examples:
Example 1
Solve the following linear programming problem graphically: Maximise Z = 4 x + y ..
(1) subject to the constraints: x + y ≤ ..
(2) 3x + y ≤ ..
(3) x ≥ 0, y ≥0 ..
(4)
Solution
The shaded region in Fig .2 is the feasible region determined by the system of constraints (2) to (4)
We observe that the feasible region OABC is bounded
So, we now use Corner Point Method to determine the maximum value of Z
The coordinates of the corner points O, A, B and C are (0, 0), (, 0), (, ) and (0, ) respectively
Now we evaluate Z at each corner point
Fig .2 Hence, maximum value of Z is 120 at the point (, 0)
Example 2
Solve the following linear programming problem graphically: Minimise Z = 200 x + 500 y ..
(1) subject to the constraints: x + 2y ≥ ..
(2) 3x + 4y ≤ ..
(3) x ≥ 0, y ≥0 ..
(4)
Solution
The shaded region in Fig .3 is the feasible region ABC determined by the system of constraints (2) to (4), which is bounded
The coordinates of corner pointsCorner Point Corresponding value of Z (0, 0) 0 (, 0) 120← Maximum (, ) 110 (0, ) Corner Point Corresponding value of Z (0, 5) 2500 (4, 3) 2300 (0, 6) 3000Minimum← Fig .3 LINEAR PROGRAMMING 401 A, B and C are (0,5), (4,3) and (0,6) respectively
Now we evaluate Z = 200 x + 500 y at these poin ts
Hence, minimum value of Z is 2300 attained at the point (4, 3)
Example 3
Solve the following problem graphically: Minimise and Maximise Z = 3 x + 9y ..
(1) subject to the constraints: x + 3y ≤ ..
(2) x + y ≥ ..
(3) x ≤y ..
(4) x ≥ 0, y ≥0 ..
(5)
Solution
First of all, let us graph the feasible region of the system of linear inequalities (2) to (5)
The feasible region ABCD is shown in the Fig .4
Note that the region is bounded
The coordinates of the corner points A, B, C and D are (0, ), (5, 5), (,) and (0, ) respectively
Fig .4Corner Corresponding value of Point Z = 3 x + 9y A (0, ) B (5, 5) C (, ) 180 D (0, ) 180Minimum Maximum (Multiple optimal solutions)←}← We now find the minimum and maximum value of Z
From the table, we find that the minimum value of Z is at the point B (5, 5) of the feasible region
The maximum value of Z on the feasible region occurs at the two corner points C (, ) and D (0, ) and it is 180 in each case
Remark Observe that in the above example, the problem has multiple optimal solutions at the corner points C and D, i.e
the both points produce same maximum value 180
In such cases, you can see that every point on the line segment CD joining the two corner points C and D also give the same maximum value
Same is also true in the case if the two points produce same minimum value
Example 4
Determine graphically the minimum value of the objective function Z =– x + y ..
(1) subject to the constraints: 2x –y ≥ – 5 ..
(2) 3x +y ≥ 3 ..
(3) 2x –3y ≤ ..
(4) x ≥0, y ≥ 0 ..
(5)
Solution
First of all, let us graph the feasible region of the system of inequalities (2) to (5)
The feasible region (shaded) is shown in the Fig .5
Observe that the feasible region is unbounded
We now evaluate Z at the corner points
From this table, we find that – 300 is the smallest value of Z at the corner point (6, 0)
Can we say that minimum value of Z is – 300? Note that if the region would have been bounded, this smallest value of Z is the minimum value of Z (Theorem 2)
But here we see that the feasible region is unbounded
Therefore, – 300 may or may not be the minimum value of Z
To decide this issue, we graph the inequality – x + y < – 300 (see Step 3(ii) of corner Point Method.) i.e., – 5x + 2y <– and check whether the resulting open half plane has points in common with feasible region or not
If it has common points, then –300 will not be the minimum value of Z
Otherwise, –300 will be the minimum value of Z.Fig .5Corner Point Z = – x + y (0, 5) 100 (0, 3) (1, 0) – (6, 0) –300 smallest← LINEAR PROGRAMMING 403 As shown in the Fig .5, it has common points
Therefore, Z = – x + y has no minimum value subject to the given constraints
In the above example, can you say whether z = – x + y has the maximum value 100 at (0,5)? For this, check whether the graph of – x + y > 100 has points in common with the feasible region
(Why?)
Example 5
Minimise Z = 3 x + 2y subject to the constraints: x + y ≥8 ..
(1) 3x + 5y ≤ ..
(2) x ≥ 0, y ≥0 ..
(3)
Solution
Let us graph the inequalities (1) to (3) (Fig .6)
Is there any feasible region? Why is so? From Fig .6, you can see that there is no point satisfying all the constraints simultaneously
Thus, the problem is having no feasible region and hence no feasible solution
Remarks From the examples which we have discussed so far , we notice some general features of linear programming problems: (i)The feasible region is always a convex region
(ii)The maximum (or minimum) solution of the objective function occurs at the vertex (corner) of the feasible region
If two corner points produce the same maximum (or minimum) value of the objective function , then every point on the line segment joining these points will also give the same maximum (or minimum) value

Summary ®A linear programming problem is one that is concerned with finding the optimal value (maximum or minimum) of a linear function of several variables (called objective function) subject to the conditions that the variables are non-negative and satisfy a set of linear inequalities (called linear constraints )
Variables are sometimes called decision variables and are non-negative
Historical Note In the World War II, when the war operations had to be planned to economise expenditure, maximise damage to the enemy , linear programming problems came to the forefront
The first problem in linear programming was formulated in 1941 by the Russian mathematician, L
Kantorovich and the American economist, F
L
Hitchcock, LINEAR PROGRAMMING 405 both of whom worked at it independently of each other
This was the well known transpor tation pr oblem
In 1945, an English economist, G .Stigler , described yet another linear programming problem – that of determining an optimal diet
In 1947, the American economist, G
B
Dantzig suggested an ef ficient method known as the simplex method which is an iterative procedure to solve any linear programming problem in a finite number of steps
L
Katorovich and American mathematical economist, T
C
Koopmans were awarded the nobel prize in the year 1975 in economics for their pioneering work in linear programming
With the advent of computers and the necessary softwares, it has become possible to apply linear programming model to increasingly complex problems in many areas

– HERMAN HANKEL .1 Introduction In our day to day life, we come across many queries such as – What is your height? How should a football player hit the ball to give a pass to another player of his team? Observe that a possible answer to the first query may be 1.6 meters, a quantity that involves only one value (magnitude) which is a real number
Such quantities are called scalars
However , an answer to the second query is a quantity (called force) which involves muscular strength (magnitude) and direction (in which another player is positioned)
Such quantities are called vectors
In mathematics, physics and engineering, we frequently come across with both types of quantities, namely , scalar quantities such as length, mass, time, distance, speed, area, volume, temperature, work, money , voltage, density , resistance etc
and vector quantities like displacement, velocity , acceleration, force, weight, momentum, electric field intensity etc
In this chapter , we will study some of the basic concepts about vectors, various operations on vectors, and their algebraic and geometric properties
These two type of properties, when considered together give a full realisation to the concept of vectors, and lead to their vital applicability in various areas as mentioned above
.2 Some Basic Concepts Let ‘ l’ be any straight line in plane or three dimensional space
This line can be given two directions by means of arrowheads
A line with one of these directions prescribed is called a directed line (Fig
1 (i), (ii)).Chapter VECT OR ALGEBRA W.R
Hamil ton (1805-1865) VECT OR ALGEBRA 339 Now observe that if we restrict the line l to the line segment AB, then a magnitude is prescribed on the line l with one of the two directions, so that we obtain a directed line segment (Fig .1(iii))
Thus, a directed line segment has magnitude as well as direction
Definition 1 A quantity that has magnitude as well as direction is called a vector
Notice that a directed line segment is a vector (Fig .1(iii)), denoted as or simply as , and read as ‘vector ’ or ‘vector ’
The point A from where the vector starts is called its initial point , and the point B where it ends is called its terminal point
The distance between initial and terminal po ints of a vector is called the magnitude (or length) of the vector , denoted as ||, or ||, or a
The arrow indicates the direction of the vector
ANote Since the length is never negative, the notation || < 0 has no meaning
Position Vector From Class XI, recall the three dimensional right handed rectangular coordinate system (Fig 1 0.2(i))
Consider a point P in space, having coordinates ( x, y, z) with respect to the origin O(0, 0, 0)
Then, the vector having O and P as its initial and terminal points, r espectively , is called the position vector of the point P with respect to O
Using distance formula (from Class XI), the magnitude of (or ) is given by ||=2 2 2x y z+ + In practice, the position vectors of points A, B, C, etc., with respect to the origin O are denoted by , , , etc., respectively (Fig .2 (ii)).Fig .1 MA THEMA TICS 340 AOP /c ° XYZ XAO BP( )x,y,zC /c /c /c103 P( )x,y,z r xyzDirection Cosines Consider the position vector of a point P( x, y, z) as in Fig .3
The angles α, β, γ made by th e vector with the positive directions of x, y and z-axes respectively , are called its direction angles
The cosine values of these angles, i.e., co sα, cosβ and cosγ are called direction cosines of the vector , and usually denoted by l, m and n, respectively
Fig .3 From Fig .3, one may note that the triangle OAP is right angled, and in it, we have
Similarly , from the right angled triangles OBP and OCP, we may write cos and cosy z r rβ = γ =
Thus, the coordinates of the point P may also be expressed as ( lr, mr,nr)
The number s lr, mr and nr, proportional to the direction cosines are called as direction ratios of vector , and denoted as a, b and c, respectively .Fig .2 VECT OR ALGEBRA 341 ANote One may note that l2 + m2 + n2 = 1 but a2 + b2 + c2 ≠ 1, in general
.3 Types of Vectors Zero Vector A vector whose initial and terminal points coincide, is called a zero vector (or null vector), and denoted as
Zero vector can not be assigned a definite direction as it has zero magnitude
Or , alternatively otherwise, it may be regarded as having any direction
The vectors represent the zero vector , Unit Vector A vector whose magnitude is unity (i.e., 1 unit) is called a unit vector
The unit vector in the direction of a given vector is denoted by ˆa
Coinitial Vectors Two or more vectors having the same initial point are called coinitial vectors
Collinear Vectors Two or more vectors are said to be collinear if they are parallel to the same line, irrespective of their magnitudes and directions
Equal Vectors Two vectors are said to be equal, if they have the same magnitude and direction regardless of the positions of their initial points, and written as
Negative of a Vector A vector whose magnitude is the same as that of a given vector (say, ), but direction is opposite to that of it, is called negative of the given vector
For example, vector is negative of the vector , and written as = –
Remark The vectors defined above are such that any of them may be subject to its parallel displacement without changing its magnitude and direction
Such vectors are called free vectors
Throughout this chapter , we will be dealing with free vectors only

The vector represents the required displacement (Fig .4)

Now consider a situation that a girl moves from A to B and then from B to C (Fig .7)
The net displacement made by the girl from point A to the point C, is given by the vector and expressed as = This is known as the triangle law of vector addition
In general, if we have two vectors and (Fig .8 (i)), then to add them, they are positioned so that the initial point of one coincides with the terminal point of the other (Fig .8(ii)).Fig .7 ab ab (i) (iii)AC ab (ii)ab+ AC B B a b––b C’ Fig .8 For example, in Fig .8 (ii), we have shifted vector without changing its magnitude and direction, so that it’ s initial point coincides with the terminal point of
Then, the vector + , represented by the third side AC of the triangle ABC, gives us the sum (or resultant) of the vectors and i.e., in triangle ABC (Fig .8 (ii)), we have = Now again, since , from the above equation, we have This means that when the sides of a triangle are taken in order , it leads to zero resultant as the initia l and terminal points get coincided (Fig .8(iii))
MA THEMA TICS 344 Now , construct a vector so that its magnitude is same as the vector , but the direction opposite to that of it (Fig .8 (iii)), i.e., = Then, on applying triangle law from the Fig .8 (iii), we have = The vector is said to represent the differ ence of
Now , consider a boat in a river going from one bank of the river to the other in a direction perpendicular to the flow of the river
Then, it is acted upon by two velocity vectors–one is the velocity imparted to the boat by its engine and other one is the velocity of the flow of river water
Under the simultaneous influence of these two velocities, the boat in actual starts travelling with a dif ferent velocity
To have a precise idea about the effective speed and direction (i.e., the resultant velocity) of the boat, we have the following law of vector addition
If we have two vectors represented by the two adjacent sides of a parallelogram in magnitude and direction (Fig .9), then their sum is represented in magnitude and direction by the diagonal of the parallelogram through their common point
This is known as the parallelogram law of vector addition
ANote From Fig .9, using the triangle law , one may note that = or = (since ) which is parallelogram law
Thus, we may say that the two laws of vector addition are equivalent to each other
Properties of vector addition Property 1 For any two vectors , = (Commutative property)Fig .9 VECT OR ALGEBRA 345 Proof Consider the parallelogram ABCD (Fig .)
Let then using the triangle law , from triangle ABC, we have Now , since the opposite sides of a parallelogram are equal and parallel, from Fig., we have, and
Again using triangle law , from triangle ADC, we have Hence = Property 2 For any three vectors , anda b c = (Associative property) Proof Let the vectors be represented by , respectively , as shown in Fig .1 1(i) and (ii)
Fig .1 1 Then = and = So =Fig
MA THEMA TICS 346 a a1212a –2aa2and = Hence = Remark The associative property of vector addition enables us to write the sum of three vectors without using brackets
Note that for any vector a , we have = Here, the zero vector is called the additive identity for the vector addition
.5 Multiplication of a Vector by a Scalar Let be a given vector and λ a scalar
Then the product of the vector by the scalar λ, denoted as λ, is called the multiplication of vector by the scalar λ
Note that, λ is also a vector , collinear to the vector
The vector λ has the direction same (or opposite) to that of vector according as the value of λ is positive (or negative)
Also, the magnitude of vector λ is |λ| times the magnitude of the vector , i.e., |λ| =|λ||| A geometric visualisation of multiplication of a vector by a scalar is given in Fig .
Fig
When λ = –1, then λ= – , which is a vector having magnitude equal to the magnitude of and direction opposite to that of the direction of
The vector – is called the negative (or additive inverse ) of vector and we always have + (– ) = (– ) + = Also, if 1=| |aλ , provided ≠ 0 i.e
is not a null vector , then |λ| =|λ||| = VECT OR ALGEBRA 347 So, λ represents the unit vector in the dir ection of
We write it as ˆa =1 | |/arrowrightnosp/arrowrightnospaa ANote For any scalar k, 0=0./arrowrightnosp /arrowrightnosp k .5.1 Components of a vector Let us take the points A(1, 0, 0), B(0, 1, 0) and C(0, 0, 1) on the x-axis, y-axis and z-axis, respectively
Then, clearly ||= 1, | |=1 and ||= 1 The vectors , each having magnitude 1, are called unit vectors along the axes OX, OY and OZ, respectively , and denoted by ˆ ˆ ˆ, and i j k , respectively (Fig .)
Now , consider the position vector of a point P(x, y, z) as in Fig .
Let P1 be the foot of the perpendicular from P on the plane XOY
We, thus, see that P1 P is parallel to z-axis
As ˆ ˆ ˆ, and i j k are the unit vectors along the x, y and z-axes, respectively , and by the definition of the coordinates of P , we have
Similarly , and .Fig
Fig
MA THEMA TICS 348 Therefore, it follows that = and = Hence, the position vector of P with reference to O is given by = This form of any vector is called its component form
Here, x, y and z are called as the scalar components of , and ˆ ˆ ˆ, andxi yj zk are called the vector components of along the respective axes
Sometimes x, y and z are also termed as rectangular components
The length of any vector =ˆ ˆ ˆxi yj zk= + + , is readily determined by applying the Pythagoras theorem twice
We note that in the right angle triangle OQP1 (Fig .) = , and in the right angle triangle OP1P, we have = Hence, the length of any vector =ˆ ˆ ˆ + xi yj zk= + is given by | | = If are any two vectors given in the component form 1 2 3ˆ ˆ ˆ + a i a j a k+ and 1 2 3ˆ ˆ ˆb i b j b k+ + , respectively , then (i)the sum (or resultant) of the vectors is given by = 1 1 2 2 3 3ˆ ˆ ˆ ( ) ( ) ( )a b i a b j a b k+ + + + + (ii) the difference of the vector is given by = 1 1 2 2 3 3ˆ ˆ ˆ ( ) ( ) ( )a b i a b j a b k- + - + - (iii) the vectors are equal if and only if a1 =b1, a2 = b2 and a3 = b3 (iv) the multiplication of vector by any scalar λ is given by λ =1 2 3ˆ ˆ ˆ ( ) ( ) ( )a i a j a kλ + λ + λ VECT OR ALGEBRA 349 The addition of vectors and the multiplication of a vector by a scalar together give the following distributive laws: Let be any two vectors, and k and m be any scalars
Then (i) (ii) (iii) Remarks (i)One may observe that whatever be the value of λ, the vector λ is always collinear to the vector
In fact, two vectors are collinear if and only if there exists a nonzero scalar λ such that
If the vectors are given in the component form, i.e
= 1 2 3ˆ ˆ ˆa i a j a k= + + and , then the two vectors are collinear if and only if 1 2 3ˆ ˆ ˆb i b j b k+ + =1 2 3ˆ ˆ ˆ( )a i a j a kλ + + ⇔1 2 3ˆ ˆ ˆb i b j b k+ + =1 2 3ˆ ˆ ˆ ( ) ( ) ( )a i a j a kλ + λ + λ ⇔1 1b a= λ ,2 2 3 3 , b a b a= λ = λ ⇔1 1b a =3 2 2 3b b a a= = λ (ii) If = 1 2 3ˆ ˆ ˆa i a j a k= + + , then a1, a2, a3 are also called direction ratios of
(iii) In case if it is given that l, m, n are direction cosines of a vector , then ˆ ˆ ˆli mj nk+ + = ˆ ˆ ˆ (cos ) (cos ) (cos ) i j kα + β + γ is the unit vector in the direction of that vector , where α, β and γ are the angles which the vector makes with x, y and z axes respectively
Example 4
Find the values of x, y and z so that the vectors and are equal

Note that two vectors are equal if and only if their corresponding components are equal
Thus, the given vectors will be equal if and only if x = 2, y = 2, z = 1 MA THEMA TICS 350

Note that the direction ratio’ s a, b, c of a vector are just the respective components x, y and z of the vector
So, for the given vector , we have a = 1, b = 1 and c = –2

Solution
Since the vector is to be directed from P to Q, clearly P is the initial point and Q is the terminal point
So, the required vector joining P and Q is the vector , given by =ˆ ˆ ˆ ( 1 2) ( 2 3) ( 4 0) i j k - - + - - + - - i.e

Then the line segment joining the points P and Q may be divided by a third point, say R, in two ways – internally (Fig .) and externally (Fig .)
Here, we intend to find the position vector for the point R with respect to the origin O
We take the two cases one by on e
Case I When R divides PQ internally (Fig .)
If R divides such that = , where m and n are positive scalars, we say that the point R divides internally in the ratio of m : n

.6 Pr oduct of Two Vectors So far we have studied about addition and subtraction of vectors
An other algebraic operation which we intend to discuss regarding vectors is their product
We may recall that product of two numbers is a number , product of two matrices is again a matrix
But in case of functions, we may multiply them in two ways, namely , multiplication of two functions pointwise and composition of two functions
Similarly , multiplication of two vectors is also defined in two ways, namely , scalar (or dot) product where the result is a scalar , and vector (or cross) product where the result is a vector
Based upon these two types of products for vectors, they have found various applications in geometry , mechanics and engineering
In this section, we will discuss these two types of products
.6.1 Scalar (or dot) product of two vectors Definition 2 The scalar product of two nonzero vectors , denoted by , isFig
MA THEMA TICS 356 defined as = where, θ is the angle between (Fig .)
If either then θ is not defined, and in this case, we define Observations 1
is a real number
2.Let be two nonzero vectors, then if and only if are perpendicular to each other
i.e
3.If θ = 0, then In particular , as θ in this case is 0
4.If θ = π, then | || | ⋅ = -/arrowrightnosp /arrowrightnosp/arrowrightnosp /arrowrightnospa b a b In particular , , as θ in this case is π
5.In view of the Observations 2 and 3, for mutually perpendicular unit vectors ˆ ˆ ˆ, and ,i j k we have ˆ ˆ ˆ ˆi i j j⋅ = ⋅ =ˆ ˆ1, k k⋅ = ˆ ˆ ˆ ˆi j j k⋅ = ⋅ =ˆˆ0 k i⋅ = 6.The angle between two nonzero vectors is given by or 7.The scalar product is commutative
i.e
(Why?) Two impor tant pr oper ties of scalar product Property 1 (Distributivity of scalar product over addition) Let be any three vectors, thenFig

Then If two vectors are given in component form as 1 2 3ˆ ˆ ˆa i a j a k+ + and 1 2 3ˆ ˆ ˆb i b j b k+ + , then their scalar product is given as =1 2 3 1 2 3ˆ ˆ ˆ ˆ ˆ ˆ( ) ( )a i a j a k b i b j b k+ + ⋅ + + =1 1 2 3 2 1 2 3ˆ ˆ ˆ ˆ ˆ ˆ ˆ ˆ( ) ( )a i b i b j b k a j b i b j b k⋅ + + + ⋅ + + + 3 1 2 3ˆ ˆ ˆ ˆ( ) a k b i b j b k⋅ + + = 1 1 1 2 1 3 2 1 2 2 2 3ˆ ˆ ˆ ˆ ˆ ˆ ˆ ˆ ˆ ˆ ˆ ˆ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( )a b i i a b i j a b i k a b j i a b j j a b j k ⋅ + ⋅ + ⋅ + ⋅ + ⋅ + ⋅ + 3 1 3 2 3 3ˆ ˆ ˆ ˆˆ ˆ( ) ( ) ( )a b k i a b k j a b k k ⋅ + ⋅ + ⋅ (Using the above Properties 1 and 2) =a1b1 + a2b2 + a3b3(Using Observation 5) Thus = 1 1 2 2 3 3a b a b a b+ + .6.2 Projection of a vector on a line Suppose a vector makes an angle θ with a given directed line l (say), in the anticlockwise dir ection (Fig .)
Then the projection of on l is a vector (say) with magnitude , and the direction of being the same (or opposite) to that of the line l, depending upon whether co sθ is positive or negative
The vector Fig
MA THEMA TICS 358 is called the projection vector , and its magnitude | | is simply called as the projection of the vector on the directed line l
For example, in each of the following figures (Fig .2 0(i) to (iv)), projection vector of along the line l is vector
Observations 1.If ˆp is the unit vector along a line l, then the projection of a vector on the line l is given by ˆa p⋅
2.Projection of a vector on other vector /arrowrightnosp b, is given by ˆ,a b⋅ or 3.If θ = 0, then the projection vector of will be itself and if θ = π, then the projection vector of will be
4.If =2πθ or 3=2πθ , then the projection vector of will be zero vector
Remark If α, β and γ are the direction angles of vector 1 2 3ˆ ˆ ˆa i a j a k= + + , then its direction cosines may be given as Also, note that are respectively the projections of along OX, OY and OZ
i.e., the scalar components a1, a2 and a3 of the vector , are precisely the projections of along x-axis, y-axis and z-axis, respectively
Further , if is a unit vector , then it may be expressed in terms of its direction cosines as ˆ ˆ ˆ cos cos cos i j k = α + β + γ Example Find the angle between two vectors with magnitudes 1 and 2 respectively and when =1

The germinal ideas of modern vector theory date from around 1800 when Caspar Wessel (1745-1818) and Jean Robert Argand (1768-1822) described that how a complex number a + ib could be given a geometric interpretation with the help of a directed line segment in a coordinate plane
William Rowen Hamilton (1805-1865) an Irish mathematician was the first to use the term vector for a directed line segment in his book Lectur es on Quaternions (1853)
Hamilton’ s method of quaternions (an ordered set of four real numbers given as: ˆ ˆ ˆ ˆ ˆ ˆ , , , a bi cj dk i j k+ + + following certain algebraic rules) was a solution to the problem of multiplying vectors in three dimensional space
Though, we must mention here that in practice, the idea of vector concept and their addition was known much earlier ever since the time of Aristotle (384-322 B.C.), a Greek philosopher , and pupil of Plato (427-348 B.C.)
That time it was supposed to be known that the combined action of two or more forces could be seen by adding them according to parallelogram law
The correct law for the composition of forces, that forces add vectorially , had been discovered in the case of perpendicular forces by S tevin-Simon (1548-1620)
In 1586 A.D., he analysed the principle of geometric addition of forces in his treatise DeBeghinselen der W eeghconst (“Principles of the Art of Weighing”), which caused a major breakthrough in the development of mechanics
But it took another 200 years for the general concept of vectors to form
In the 1880, Josaih Willard Gibbs (1839-1903), an American physicist and mathematician, and Oliver Heaviside (1850-1925), an English engineer , created what we now know as vector analysis , essentially by separating the real ( scalar ) MA THEMA TICS 376 part of quaternion from its imaginary ( vector ) part
In 1881 and 1884, Gibbs printed a treatise entitled Element of V ector Analysis
This book gave a systematic and concise account of vectors
However , much of the credit for demonstrating the applications of vectors is due to the D
Heaviside and P .G

– BIRKHOFF 8.1 Introduction In geometry , we have learnt formulae to calculate areas of various geometrical figures including triangles, rectangles, trapezias and circles
Such formulae are fundamental in the applications of mathematics to many real life problems
The formulae of elementary geometry allow us to calculate areas of many simple figures
However , they are inadequate for calculating the areas enclosed by curves
For that we shall need some concepts of Integral Calculus
In the previous chapter , we have studied to find the area bounded by the curve y = f (x), the ordinates x = a, x = b and x-axis, while calculating definite integral as the limit of a sum
Here, in this chapter , we shall study a specific application of integrals to find the area under simple curves, area between lines and arcs of circles, parabolas and ellipses (standard forms only)
We shall also deal with finding the area bounded by the above said curves
8.2Area under Simple Curves In the previous chapter , we have studied definite integral as the limit of a sum and how to evaluate definite integral using Fundamental Theorem of Calculus
Now , we consider the easy and intuitive way of finding the area bounded by the curve y = f(x), x-axis and the ordinates x = a and x = b
From Fig 8.1, we can think of area under the curve as composed of large number of very thin vertical strips
Consider an arbitrary strip of height y and width dx, then dA (area of the elementary strip )= ydx, where, y = f(x).Chapter 8 APPLICA TION OF INTEGRALS A.L
Cauchy (1789-1857) APPLICATION OF INTEGRALS 293 Fig 8.2This area is called the elementar y area which is located at an arbitrary position within the region which is specified by some value of x between a and b
We can think of the total area A of the region between x-axis, ordinates x = a, x = b and the curve y = f (x) as the result of adding up the elementary areas of thin strips across the region PQRSP
Symbolical ly, we express A = A ( )b b b a a ad ydx f x dx= =   The area A of the region bounded by the curve x = g (y), y-axis and the lines y = c, y = d is given by A = ( )d d c cxdy g y dy=  Here, we consider horizontal strips as shown in the Fig 8.2 Rem ark If the position of the curve under consideration is below the x-axis, then since f(x) < 0 from x = a to x = b, as shown in Fig 8.3, the area bounded by the curve, x-axis and the ordinates x = a, x = b come out to be negative
But, it is only the numerical value of the area whic h is taken into consideration
Thus, if the area is negative, we take its absolute value, i.e., ( )b af x dx
Fig 8.3 Generally , it may happen that some portion of the curve is above x-axis and some is below the x-axis as shown in the Fig 8.4
Here, A1 < 0 and A2 > 0
Therefore, the area A bounded by the curve y = f (x), x-axis and the ordinates x = a and x = b is given by A = |A1| + A2
Example 1

Historical Note The origin of the Integral Calculus goes back to the early period of development of Mathematics and it is related to the method of exhaustion developed by the mathematicians of ancient Greece
This method arose in the solution of problems on calculating areas of plane figures, surface areas and volumes of solid bodies etc
In this sense, the method of exhaustion can be regarded as an early method APPLICATION OF INTEGRALS 299 of integration
The greatest development of method of exhaustion in the early period was obtained in the works of Eudoxus (440 B.C.) and Archimedes (300 B.C.) Systematic approach to the theory of Calculus began in the th century
In 1665, Newton began his work on the Calculus described by him as the theory of fluxions and used his theory in finding the tangent and radius of curvature at any point on a curve
Newton introduced the basic notion of inverse function called the anti derivative (indefinite integral) or the inverse method of tangents
During 1684-, Leibnitz published an article in the Acta Eruditorum which he called Calculas summatorius , since it was connected with the summation of a number of infinitely small areas, whose sum, he indicated by the symbol ‘ ∫’
In 1696, he followed a suggestion made by J
Bernoulli and changed this article to Calculus integrali
This corresponded to Newton’ s inverse method of tangents
Both Newton and Leibnitz adopted quite independent lines of approach which was radically dif ferent
However , respective theories accomplished results that were practically identical
Leibnitz used the notion of definite integral and what is quite certain is that he first clearly appreciated tie up between the antiderivative and the definite integral
Conclusively , the fundamental concepts and theory of Integral Calculus and primarily its relationships with Differential Calculus were developed in the work of P.de Fermat, I
Newton and G
Leibnitz at the end of th century
However , this justification by the concept of limit was only developed in the works of A.L
Cauchy in the early th century
Lastly , it is worth mentioning the following quotation by Lie Sophie’ s: “It may be said that the conceptions of differential quotient and integral which in their origin certainly go back to Archimedes were introduced in Science by the investigations of Kepler , Descartes, Cavalieri, Fermat and Wallis ...
The discovery that differentiation and integration are inverse operations belongs to Newton and Leibnitz”

HILBERT 9.1 Introduction In Class XI and in Chapter 5 of the present book, we discussed how to differentiate a given function f with respect to an independent variable, i.e., how to find f′(x) for a given function f at each x in its domain of definition
Further , in the chapter on Integral Calculus, we discussed how to find a function f whose derivative is the function g, which may also be formulated as follows: For a given function g, find a f unction f such that dy dx =g(x), where y = f(x) ..
(1) An equation of the form (1) is known as a differ ential equation
A formal definition will be given later
These equations arise in a variety of applications, may it be in Physics, Chemistry , Biology , Anthropology , Geology , Economics etc
Hence, an indepth study of dif ferential equations has assumed prime importance in all modern scientific investigations
In this chapter , we will study some basic concepts related to dif ferential equation, general and particular solutions of a differential equation, formation of differential equations, some methods to solve a first order - first degree differential equation and some applications of differential equations in different areas
9.2 Basic Concepts We are already familiar with the equations of the type: x2 – 3x + 3 = 0 ..
(1) sin x + cos x =0 ..
(2) x + y =7 ..
(3)Chapter 9 DIFFERENTIAL EQUA TIONS Henri Poincare (1854-1912 ) DIFFERENTIAL EQUA TIONS 301 Let us consider the equation: dyx ydx+ =0 ..
(4) We see that equations (1), (2) and (3) involve independent and/or dependent variable (variables) only but equation (4) involves variables as well as derivative of the dependent variable y with respect to the independent variable x
Such an equation is called a differ ential equation
In general, an equation involving derivative (derivatives) of the dependent variable with respect to independent variable (variables) is called a differential equation
A differential equation involving derivatives of the dependent variable with respect to only one independent variable is called an ordinary differential equation, e.g., 3 2 d y dy dx dx +   =0 is an ordinary differential equation ...
(5) Of course, there are differential equations involving derivatives with respect to more than one independent variables, called partial differential equations but at this stage we shall confine ourselves to the study of ordinary dif ferential equations only
Now onward, we will use the term ‘differential equation’ for ‘ordinary differential equation’
ANote 1.We shall prefer to use the following notations for derivatives: 2 3 2 3, ,dy d y d yy y ydx dx dx′ ′ ′ ′′′= = = 2.For derivatives of higher order , it will be inconvenient to use so many dashes as supersuffix therefore, we use the notation yn for nth order derivative n nd y dx
9.2.1
Order of a differential equation Order of a differential equation is defined as the order of the highest order derivative of the dependent variable with respect to the independent variable involved in the given differential equation
Consider the following differential equations: dy dx =ex..
(6) Reprint 2025- 302 2 2d yy dx+ =0 ..
(7) 2 2 3 2d y d yx dx dx   +      =0 ..
(8) The equations (6), (7) and (8) involve the highest derivative of first, second and third order respectively
Therefore, the order of these equations are 1, 2 and 3 respectively
9.2.2 Degree of a differential equation To study the degree of a dif ferential equation, the key point is that the dif ferential equation must be a polynomial equation in derivatives, i.e., y′, y″, y″′ etc
Consider the following differ ential equations: 2 3 d y d y dyydx dx dx + - +    =0 ..
(9) 2 2sindy dyydx dx   + -       =0 ..
() sindy dy dx dx +   =0 ..
() We observe that equation (9) is a polynomial equation in y″′, y″ and y′, equation () is a polynomial equation in y′ (not a polynomial in y though)
Degree of such differential equations can be defined
But equation (1 1) is not a polynomial equation in y′ and degree of such a differential equation can not be defined
By the degree of a differential equation, when it is a polynomial equation in derivatives, we mean the highest power (positive integral index) of the highest order derivative involved in the given differential equation
In view of the above definition, one may observe that differential equations (6), (7), (8) and (9) each are of degree one, equation () is of degree two while the degree of differential equation (1 1) is not defined
ANote Order and degree (if defined) of a differential equation are always positive integers

Solution
(i)The highest order derivative present in the differential equation is dy dx, so its order is one
It is a polynomial equation in y′ and the highest power raised to dy dx is one, so its degree is one
(ii) The highest order derivative present in the given differential equation is 2 2d y dx, so its order is two
It is a polynomial equation in 2 2d y dx and dy dx and the highest power raised to 2 2d y dx is one, so its degree is one
(iii) The highest order derivative present in the differential equation is y′′′, so its order is three
The given differential equation is not a polynomial equation in its derivatives and so its degree is not defined

General and Particular
Solution
s of a Differential Equation In earlier Classes, we have solved the equations of the type: x2 + 1 = 0 ..
(1) sin2 x – cos x =0 ..
(2)
Solution
of equations (1) and (2) are numbers, real or complex, that will satisfy the given equation i.e., when that number is substituted for the unknown x in the given equation, L.H.S
becomes equal to the R.H.S.
Now consider the differential equation 2 d yy dx+ = ..
(3) In contrast to the first two equations, the solution of this differential equation is a function φ that will satisfy it i.e., when the function φ is substituted for the unknown y (dependent variable) in the given differential equation, L.H.S
becomes equal to R.H.S.
The curve y = φ (x) is called the solution curve (integral curve) of the given differential equation
Consider the function given by y = φ (x) =a sin ( x + b), ..
(4) where a, b ∈ R
When this function and its derivative are substituted in equation (3), L.H.S
= R.H.S.
So it is a solution of the differential equation (3)
Let a and b be given some particular values say a = 2 and 4bπ=, then we get a function y = φ1(x) = 2sin4xπ +  ..
(5) When this function and its derivative are substituted in equation (3) again L.H.S
= R.H.S.
Therefore φ1 is also a solution of equation (3)
DIFFERENTIAL EQUA TIONS 305 Function φ consists of two arbitrary constants (parameters) a, b and it is called general solution of the given differential equation
Whereas function φ1 contains no arbitrary constants but only the particular values of the parameters a and b and hence is called a particular solution of the given differential equation
The solution which contains arbitrary constants is called the general solution (primitive ) of the differential equation
The solution free from arbitrary constants i.e., the solution obtained from the general solution by giving particular values to the arbitrary constants is called a particular solution of the differential equation
Example 2
Verify that the function y = e–3x is a solution of the dif ferential equation 2 0d y dyydx dx+ - =
Solution
Given function is y = e–3x
Differentiating both sides of equation with respect to x , we get x dyedx-= - ..
(1) Now , differentiating (1) with respect to x, we have 2 2d y dx =9e– 3x Substituting the values of 2 2,d y dy dx dxand y in the given differential equation, we get L.H.S
= 9 e–3x + (–3 e–3x) – 6
e–3x = 9 e–3x – 9 e–3x = 0 = R.H.S.
Therefore, the given function is a solution of the given differential equation
Example 3
Verify that the function y = a cos x + b sin x, where, a, b ∈ R is a solution of the differential equation 2 d yy dx+ =
Solution
The given function is y =a cos x + b sin x ..
(1) Differentiating both sides of equation (1) with respect to x, successively , we get dy dx =– a sinx + b cosx 2 2d y dx =– a cosx – b sinx Reprint 2025- 306 Substituting the values of 2 2d y dx and y in the given differential equation, we get L.H.S
= (– a cos x – b sin x) + (a cos x + b sin x) = 0 = R.H.S
Therefore, the given function is a solution of the given differential equation

y = 2 2a x- x ∈ (–a, a):x + y dy dx = 0 ( y ≠ 0) .The number of arbitrary constants in the general solution of a differential equation of fourth order are: (A) 0 (B) 2 (C) 3 (D) 4
The number of arbitrary constants in the particular solution of a differential equation of third order are: (A) 3 (B) 2 (C) 1 (D) 0 9.4
Methods of Solving First Order, First Degr ee Dif ferential Equations In this section we shall discuss three methods of solving first order first degree differential equations
9.4.1 Differential equations with variables separable A first order-first degree differential equation is of the form dy dx =F(x, y) ..
(1) DIFFERENTIAL EQUA TIONS 307 If F(x, y) can be expressed as a product g ( x) h(y), where, g(x) is a function of x and h(y) is a function of y, then the dif ferential equation (1) is said to be of variable separable type
The differential equation (1) then has the form dy dx =h (y)
g(x) ..
(2) If h(y) ≠ 0, separating the variables, (2) can be rewritten as 1 ( )h y dy =g(x) dx ..
(3) Integrating both sides of (3), we get 1 ( )dyh y  = ( )g x dx  ..
(4) Thus, (4) provides the solutions of given differential equation in the form H(y) =G(x) + C Here, H ( y) and G ( x) are the anti derivatives of 1 ( )h y and g(x) respectively and C is the arbitrary constant
Example 4
Find the general solution of the differential equation 1 2dy x dx y+= -, (y ≠ 2)
Solution
We have dy dx =1 2x y+ -..
(1) Separating the variables in equation (1), we get (2 – y) dy =(x + 1) dx ..
(2) Integrating both sides of equation (2), we get (2 )y dy-  =( 1)x dx+  or2 yy- =2 1C2xx+ + or x2 + y2 + 2x – 4y + 2 C1 =0 or x2 + y2 + 2x – 4y + C = 0, where C = 2C1 which is the general solution of equation (1)
Reprint 2025- 308
Example 5
Find the general solution of the differential equation 2 1dy y dx x+= +
Solution
Since 1 + y2 ≠ 0, therefore separating the variables, the given differential equation can be written as dy y+ =dx x+..
(1) Integrating both sides of equation (1), we get dy y+  =dx x+  or tan–1 y =tan–1x + C which is the general solution of equation (1)
Example 6

Historical Note One of the principal languages of Science is that of differential equations
Interestingly , the date of birth of dif ferential equations is taken to be November , ,1675, when Gottfried Wilthelm Freiherr Leibnitz (1646 - 1716) first put in black and white the identity 2y dy y = , thereby introducing both the symbols ∫ and dy
Leibnitz was actually interested in the problem of finding a curve whose tangents were prescribed
This led him to discover the ‘ method of separation of variables ’ 1691
A year later he formulated the ‘ method of solving the homogeneous DIFFERENTIAL EQUA TIONS 337 —vv—differ ential equations of the first or der’
He went further in a very short time to the discovery of the ‘ method of solving a linear differ ential equation of the first-or der’
How surprising is it that all these methods came from a single man and that too within years of the birth of differential equations! In the old days, what we now call the ‘solution’ of a differential equation, was used to be referred to as ‘integral’ of the differential equation, the word being coined by James Bernoulli (1654 - 1705) in 1690
The word ‘solution was first used by Joseph Louis Lagrange (1736 - 1813) in 1774, which was almost hundred years since the birth of differential equations
It was Jules Henri Poincare (1854 - 1912) who strongly advocated the use of the word ‘solution’ and thus the word ‘solution’ has found its deserved place in modern terminology
The name of the ‘method of separation of variables ’ is due to John Bernoulli (1667 - 1748), a younger brother of James Bernoulli
Application to geometric problems were also considered
It was again John Bernoulli who first brought into light the intricate nature of differential equations
In a letter to Leibnitz, dated May , 1715, he revealed the solutions of the differential equation x2 y″ = 2y, which led to three types of curves, viz., parabolas, hyperbolas and a class of cubic curves
This shows how varied the solutions of such innocent looking differential equation can be
From the second half of the twentieth century attention has been drawn to the investigation of this complicated nature of the solutions of differential equations, under the heading ‘ qualitative analysis of differ ential equations ’
Now-a-days, this has acquired prime importance being absolutely necessary in almost all investigations

— JAMES B
BRISTOL 7.1 Introduction Differential Calculus is centred on the concept of the derivative
The original motivation for the derivative was the problem of defining tangent lines to the graphs of functions and calculating the slope of such lines
Integral Calculus is motivated by the problem of defining and calculating the area of the region bounded by the graph of the functions
If a function f is differentiable in an interval I, i.e., its derivative f′exists at each point of I, then a natural question arises that given f′at each point of I, can we determine the function? The functions that could possibly have given function as a derivative are called anti derivatives (or primitive) of the function
Further , the formula that gives all these anti derivatives is called the indefinite integral of the function and such process of finding anti derivatives is called integration
Such type of problems arise in many practical situations
For instance, if we know the instantaneous velocity of an object at any instant, then there arises a natural question, i.e., can we determine the position of the object at any instant? There are several such practical and theoretical situations where the process of integration is involved
The development of integral calculus arises out of the efforts of solving the problems of the following types: (a) the problem of finding a function whenever its derivative is given, (b) the problem of finding the area bounded by the graph of a function under certain conditions
These two problems lead to the two forms of the integrals, e.g., indefinite and definite integrals, which together constitute the Integral Calculus .Chapter 7 INTEGRALS G .W
Leibnitz (1646-1716) There is a connection, known as the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus , between indefinite integral and definite integral which makes the definite integral as a practical tool for science and engineering
The definite integral is also used to solve many interesting problems from various disciplines like economic s, finance and probability
In this Chapter , we shall confine ourselves to the study of indefinite and definite integrals and their elementary properties including some techniques of integration
7.2 Integration as an Inverse Process of Differentiation Integration is the inverse process of differentiation
Instead of differentiating a function, we are given the derivative of a function and asked to find its primitive, i.e., the original function
Such a process is called integration or anti differ entiation
Let us consider the following examples: We know that (sin )dxdx =cos x ..
(1) 3 ( )3d x dx =x2..
(2) and ( )xdedx=ex..
(3) We observe that in (1), the function cos x is the derived function of sin x
We say that sin x is an anti derivative (or an integral) of cos x
Similarly , in (2) and (3), 3 3x and ex are the anti derivatives (or integrals) of x2 and ex, respectively
Again, we note that for any real number C, treated as constant function, its derivative is zero and hence, we can write (1), (2) and (3) as follows : (sin + C) cos =dx xdx, 3 2( + C)3=d xxdxand ( + C) =x x de edx Thus, anti derivatives (or integrals) of the above cited functions are not unique
Actually , there exist infinitely many anti derivatives of each of these functions which can be obtained by choosing C arbitrarily from the set of real numbers
For this reason C is customarily referred to as arbitrary constant
In fact, C is the parameter by varying which one gets different anti derivatives (or integrals) of the given function
More generally , if there is a function F such that F ( ) = ( )dx f xdx, ∀x ∈ I (interval), then for any arbitrary real number C, (also called constant of integration ) [ ]F ( ) + Cdxdx =f(x), x ∈ I INTEGRALS 227 Thus, {F + C, C ∈ R} denotes a family of anti derivatives of f
Remark Functions with same derivatives dif fer by a constant
To show this, let g and h be two functions having the same derivatives on an interval I
Consider the function f = g – h defined by f(x) = g(x) – h(x), ∀x ∈ I Thendf dx=f′ = g′ – h′ giving f′ (x) = g′ (x) – h′ (x) ∀x ∈ I or f′ (x) =0, ∀x ∈ I by hypothesis, i.e., the rate of change of f with respect to x is zero on I and hence f is constant
In view of the above remark, it is justified to infer that the family {F + C, C ∈ R} provides all possible anti derivatives of f
We introduce a new symbol, namely , ( )f x dx which will represent the entire class of anti derivatives read as the indefinite integral of f with respect to x
Symbolically , we write ( ) = F ( ) + Cf x dx x
Notation Given that ( )dyf xdx= , we write y = ( )f x dx
For the sake of convenience, we mention below the following symbols/terms/phrases with their meanings as given in the Table (7.1)

From these formulae, we can write down immediately the corresponding formulae (referred to as standard formulae) for the integrals of these functions, as listed below which will be used to find integrals of other functions

However , in any specific problem one has to keep it in mind
7.2.1 Some properties of indefinite integral In this sub section, we shall derive some properties of indefinite integrals
(I)The process of differentiation and integration are inverses of each other in the sense of the following results : ( )df x dxdx =f(x) and ( )f x dx′ =f(x) + C, where C is any arbitrary constant
Proof Let F be any anti derivative of f, i.e., F( )dxdx =f(x) Then ( )f x dx =F(x) + C Therefore ( )df x dxdx = ( )F ( ) + Cdxdx = F ( ) = ( )dx f xdx Similarly , we note that f′(x) = ( )df xdx and hence ( )f x dx′ =f(x) + C where C is arbitrary constant called constant of integration
(II) Two indefinite integrals with the same derivative lead to the same family of curves and so they are equivalent
Proof Let f and g be two functions such that ( )df x dxdx = ( )dg x dxdx or ( ) ( )df x dx – g x dxdx   = 0 Hence ( ) ( )f x dx – g x dx  =C, where C is any real number (Why?) or ( )f x dx = ( ) Cg x dx + So the families of curves { } 1 1 ( ) C , C Rf x dx + ∈ and { } 2 2 ( ) C , C Rg x dx + ∈ are identical
Hence, in this sense, ( ) and ( )f x dx g x dx  are equivalent
ANote The equivalence of the families { } 1 1 ( ) + C ,Cf x dx ∈ R and { } 2 2 ( ) + C ,Cg x dx ∈ R is customarily expressed by writing ( ) = ( )f x dx g x dx  , without mentioning the parameter
(III) [ ] ( ) + ( ) ( ) + ( )f x g x dx f x dx g x dx =    Proof By Property (I), we have [ ( ) + ( )]df x g x dxdx  =f(x) + g(x) ..
(1) On the otherhand, we find that ( ) + ( )df x dx g x dxdx   = ( ) + ( )d df x dx g x dxdx dx  =f(x) + g(x) ..
(2) Thus, in view of Property (II), it follows by (1) and (2) that ( ) ( ) ( )f x g x dx+ = ( ) ( )f x dx g x dx + 
(IV) For any real number k, ( ) ( )k f x dx k f x dx =  INTEGRALS 231 Proof By the Property (I), ( ) ( )dk f x dx k f xdx=
Also ( )dk f x dxdx  = ( ) = ( )dk f x dx k f xdx Therefore, using the Property (II), we have ( ) ( )k f x dx k f x dx = 
(V) Properties (III) and (IV) can be generalised to a finite number of functions f1, f2, ..., fn and the real numbers, k1, k2, ..., kn giving [ ] 1 1 2 2( ) ( ) ( )n n k f x k f x ..
k f x dx + + + = 1 1 2 2( ) ( ) ( )n n k f x dx k f x dx ..

To find an anti derivative of a given function, we search intuitively for a function whose derivative is the given function
The search for the requisite function for finding an anti derivative is known as integration by the method of inspection
We illustrate it through some examples
Example 1
Write an anti derivative for each of the following functions using the method of inspection: (i)cos 2 x (ii) 3x2 + 4x3(iii)1 x, x ≠ 0
Solution
(i)We look for a function whose derivative is cos 2 x
Recall that d dx sin 2 x =2 cos 2 x or cos 2 x = 1 2d dx (sin 2 x) =1sin dxdx      Therefore, an anti derivative of cos 2 x is 1sin x
(ii) We look for a function whose derivative is 3 x2 + 4x3
Note that ( )3 4 dx xdx+ = 3x2 + 4x3
Therefore, an anti derivative of 3 x2 + 4x3 is x3 + x4
(iii) We know that 1 1 1(log ) 0 and [log ( )] ( 1) 0d dx ,x –x – ,xdx x dx –x x= > = = < Combining above, we get ( )1log 0dx ,xdx x= ≠ Therefore, 1logdx xx=∫ is one of the anti derivatives of 1 x
Example 2
Find the following integrals: (i)3 x –dx x∫ (ii) 2 3( 1)x dx+∫(iii) ∫3 ( 2 – )+ xx e dxx
Solution
(i)We have 3 2 – x –dx xdx– x dx x=∫ ∫ ∫(by Property V) = 1 1 2 1 1 2C C1 1 2 1–x x––+ +   + +   + +   ; C1, C2 are constants of integration = 2 1 1 2C C2 1–x x– ––+ = 2 1 + C C2x–x+ = + C2x x+ , where C = C1 – C2 is another constant of integration
ANote From now onwards, we shall write only one constant of integration in the final answer
(ii)We have 2 2 3 3( 1)x dx x dx dx+ = +∫ ∫ ∫ = 3 C213xx+ + + + = 5 C5x x+ + INTEGRALS 233 (iii)We have 3 3 2 1( 2 ) 2x xx e – dx x dx e dx – dxx x+ = +    =312 2 – log + C312x xe x+ + + =5 222 – log + C5xx e x+

Example 4
Find the anti derivative F of f defined by f (x) = 4 x3 – 6, where F (0) = 3
Solution
One anti derivative of f (x) is x4 – 6x since 4( 6 )dx – xdx =4x3 – 6 Therefore, the anti derivative F is given by F(x) =x4 – 6x + C, where C is constant
Given that F(0) = 3, which gives, 3 =0 – 6 * 0 + C or C = 3 Hence, the required anti derivative is the unique function F defined by F(x) =x4 – 6x + 3
Remarks (i)We see that if F is an anti derivative of f, then so is F + C, where C is any constant
Thus, if we know one anti derivative F of a function f, we can write down an infinite number of anti derivatives of f by adding any constant to F expressed by F(x) + C, C ∈ R
In applications, it is often necessary to satisfy an additional condition which then determines a specific value of C giving unique anti derivative of the given function
(ii) Sometimes, F is not expressible in terms of elementary functions viz., polynomial, logarithmic, exponential, trigonometric functions and their inverses etc
We are therefore blocked for finding ( )f x dx
For example, it is not possible to find 2– xe dx by inspection since we can not find a function whose derivative is 2– xe (iii) When the variable of integration is denoted by a variable other than x, the integral formulae are modified accordingly

It was based on inspection, i.e., on the search of a function F whose derivative is f which led us to the integral of f
However , this method, which depends on inspection, is not very suitable for many functions
Hence, we need to develop additional techniques or methods for finding the integrals by reducing them into standard forms
Prominent among them are methods based on: 1.Integration by Substitution 2.Integration using Partial Fractions 3.Integration by Parts 7.3.1 Integration by substitution In this section, we consider the method of integration by substitution
The given integral ( )f x dx can be transformed into another form by changing the independent variable x to t by substituting x = g (t)
Consider I = ( )f x dx Put x = g(t) so that dx dt = g′(t)
We write dx =g′(t) dt Thus I = ( ) ( ( )) ( )f x dx f g t g t dt = ′  This change of variable formula is one of the important tools available to us in the name of integration by substitution
It is often important to guess what will be the useful substitution
Usually , we make a substitution for a function whose derivative also occurs in the integrand as illustrated in the following examples
Example 5
Integrate the following functions w .r.t
x: (i)sin mx (ii) 2x sin ( x2 + 1) (iii)4 2tan sec x x x(iv)1 2sin (tan ) 1–x x+
Solution
(i)We know that derivative of mx is m
Thus, we make the substitution mx = t so that mdx = dt
Therefore, 1sin sinmx dx t dtm=  = – 1 mcos t + C = – 1 mcos mx + C (ii) Derivative of x2 + 1 is 2 x
Thus, we use the substitution x2 + 1 = t so that 2x dx = dt
Therefore, sin ( 1) sinx x dx t dt + =  = – cos t + C = – cos ( x2 + 1) + C (iii) Derivative of x is 1 1 2 2– x x=
Thus, we use the substitution 1so that giving 2x t dx dt x= = dx = 2t dt
Thus,4 2 4 2tan sec 2 tan sec x x t t t dtdxt x=   = 4 tan sec t t dt Again, we make another substitution tan t = u so that sec2 t dt = du INTEGRALS 237 Therefore,4 2 tan sec 2 t t dt u du =  = 5 2 C5u+ =5 2tan C5t+ (since u = tan t) =5 2tan C (since )5x t x+ = Hence,4 2tan sec x xdx x =5 2tan C5x+ Alternatively , make the substitution tan x t= (iv) Derivative of 1 tan 1–x x= +
Thus, we use the substitution tan–1 x = t so that dx x+ = dt
Therefore , 1 2sin (tan )sin 1–xdx t dt x= +  = – cos t + C = – co s(tan –1x) + C Now , we discuss some important integrals involving trigonometric functions and their standard integrals using substitution technique
These will be used later without reference

We find the integral reduced to the form 2 dt at k±∫ depending upon the sign of 2 c b–a a      and hence can be evaluated
(8) To find the integral of the type , proceeding as in (7), we obtain the integral using the standard formulae
(9) To find the integral of the type 2px qdx ax bx c+ + +∫ , where p, q, a, b, c are constants, we are to find real numbers A, B such that 2+ = A ( ) + B = A (2 ) + Bdpx q ax bx c ax bdx+ + + To determine A and B, we equate from both sides the coef ficients of x and the constant terms

If the degree of P(x) is less than the degree of Q(x), then the rational function is called proper , otherwise, it is called improper
The improper rational functions can be reduced to the proper rational INTEGRALS 253 functions by long division process
Thus, if P( ) Q( )x x is improper , then 1P ( ) P( )T( )Q( ) Q( )x xxx x= + , where T(x) is a polynomial in x and 1P ( ) Q( )x xis a proper rational function
As we know how to integrate polynomials, the integration of any rational function is reduced to the integration of a proper rational function
The rational functions which we shall consider here for integration purposes will be those whose denominators can be factorised into linear and quadratic factors
Assume that we want to evaluate P( ) Q( )xdxx , where P( ) Q( )x x is proper rational function
It is always possible to write the integrand as a sum of simpler rational functions by a method called partial fraction decomposition
After this, the integration can be carried out easily using the already known methods
The following Table 7.2 indicates the types of simpler partial fractions that are to be associated with various kind of rational functions

Example 1
1 Find ( 1) ( 2)dx x x+ +
Solution
The integrand is a proper rational function
Therefore, by using the form of partial fraction [T able 7.2 (i)], we write 1 ( 1) ( 2)x x+ + =A B 1 2x x++ +..
(1) where, real numbers A and B are to be determined suitably
This gives 1 =A (x + 2) + B ( x + 1)
Equating the coefficients of x and the constant term, we get A + B = 0 and 2A + B = 1 Solving these equations, we get A =1 and B = – 1
Thus, the integrand is given by 1 ( 1) ( 2)x x+ + =1 – 1 1 2x x++ + Therefore,( 1) ( 2)dx x x+ + =1 2dx dx–x x+ +  =log 1 log 2 Cx x+ - + + =1log C2x x+++ Remark The equation (1) above is an identity , i.e
a statement true for all (permissible) values of x
Some authors use the symbol ‘ ≡’ to indicate that the statement is an identity and use the symbol ‘=’ to indicate that the statement is an equation, i.e., to indicate that the statem ent is true only for certain values of x
Example Find 2 5 6xdx x x+ - +

Here the integrand 2 5 6x x – x+ + is not proper rational function, so we divide x2 + 1 by x2 – 5x + 6 and find that INTEGRALS 255 2 5 6x x – x+ + = 5 5 1( 2) ( 3) 5 6x – x – x – x – x – x+ = + + Let5 5 ( 2) ( 3)x – x – x – =A B 2 3x – x –+ So that 5x – 5 = A (x – 3) + B ( x – 2) Equating the coef ficients of x and constant terms on both sides, we get A + B = 5 and 3A + 2B = 5
Solving these equations, we get A = – 5 and B = Thus,2 5 6x x – x+ + =5 1012 3x – x –- + Therefore,2 5 6xdx x – x+ + = 102 3dxdx dxx – x –- +   =x – 5 log |x – 2| + log |x – 3| + C

Solving these equations, we get 5 A B and C4 2 4– –,= = =
Thus the integrand is given by 2 ( 1) ( 3)x x x- + + = 211 5 4 ( 1) 4 ( 3) 2 ( 1)– –x x x + + + Therefore, 2 ( 1) ( 3)x x x- + + =211 5 4 1 2 4 3 ( 1)dx dx dx– x x x- + + +   = 5 log +1 log 3 C4 2 ( +1) 4x xx+ - + + = +1 5log + C4 + 3 2 ( + 1)x x x+ Example Find 2 2 2( 1) ( 4)xdx x x+ +

If u and are any two differentiable functions of a single variable x (say)
Then, by the product rule of differentiation, we have ( )duvdx =dv duu vdx dx+ Integrating both sides, we get uv =dv duu dx dxdx dx+  ordvu dxdx =duuv – dxdx..
(1) Let u =f(x) and dv dx= g(x)
Then du dx=f′(x) and = ( )g x dx Therefore, expression (1) can be rewritten as ( ) ( )f x g x dx = ( ) ( ) [ ( ) ] ( )f x g x dx – g x dx f x dx ′   i.e., ( ) ( )f x g x dx = ( ) ( ) [ ( ) ( ) ]f x g x dx – f x g x dx dx ′   If we take f as the first function and g as the second function, then this formula may be stated as follows: “The integral of the product of two functions = (first function) * (integral of the second function) – Integral of [(differential coefficient of the first function) * (integral of the second function)]” Example Find cosx x dx
Solution
Put f (x) = x (first function) and g (x) = cos x (second function)
Then, integration by parts gives cosx x dx = cos [ ( ) cos ]dx x dx – x x dx dxdx   =sin sinx x – x dx = x sin x + cos x + C Suppose, we take f(x) =cos x and g(x) = x
Then cosx x dx =cos [ (cos ) ]dx x dx – x x dx dxdx   =( )2 2 cos sin2 2x xx x dx + Thus, it shows that the integral cosx x dx is reduced to the comparatively more complicated integral having more power of x
Therefore, the proper choice of the first function and the second function is significant
Remarks (i)It is worth mentioning that integration by parts is not applicable to product of functions in all cases
For instance, the method does not work for sinx x dx
The reason is that there does not exist any function whose derivative is x sin x
(ii) Observe that while finding the integral of the second function, we did not add any constant of integration
If we write the integral of the second function cos x INTEGRALS 261 as sin x + k, where k is any constant, then cosx x dx = (sin ) (sin )x x k x k dx + - + =(sin ) (sinx x k x dx k dx + - -  =(sin ) cos Cx x k x – kx + - + = sin cos Cx x x + + This shows that adding a constant to the integral of the second function is superfluous so far as the final result is concerned while applying the method of integration by parts
(iii) Usually , if any function is a power of x or a polynomial in x, then we take it as the first function
However , in cases where other function is inverse trigonometric function or logarithmic function, then we take them as first function
Example Find logx dx
Solution
To start with, we are unable to guess a function whose derivative is log x
We take log x as the first function and the constant function 1 as the second function
Then, the integral of the second function is x
Hence, (log .1)x dx =log 1 [ (log ) 1 ]dx dx x dx dxdx-   =1(log ) – log Cx x x dx x x – xx⋅ = +
Example Find xx e dx
Solution
Take first function as x and second function as ex
The integral of the second function is ex
Therefore,xx e dx = 1x xx e e dx- ⋅ = xex – ex + C
Example Find 1 2sin 1–x xdx x-
Solution
Let first function be sin – 1x and second function be x x-
First we find the integral of the second function, i.e., x dx x-
Put t =1 – x2
Then dt = – 2 x dx Therefore,x dx x- =1 2dt– t = 2– 1t x= - - Hence,1 2sin 1–x xdx x- = ( )1 2 2 (sin ) 1 ( 1 ) 1–x – x – x dx x- - - - =2 sin C– x x x-- + + = 2 sin C x – x x-- + Alternatively , this integral can also be worked out by making substitution sin–1 x = θ and then integrating by parts
Example Find sinxe x dx
Solution
Take ex as the first function and sin x as second function
Then, integrating by parts, we have I sin ( cos ) cosx x xe x dx e – x e x dx= = +  =– ex cos x + I1 (say) ..
(1) Taking ex and cos x as the first and second functions, respectively , in I1, we get I1 = sin sinx xe x – e x dx Substituting the value of I1 in (1), we get I =– ex cos x + ex sin x – I or 2I = ex (sin x – cos x) Hence, I = sin (sin cos ) + C2x x ee x dx x – x = Alternatively , above integral can also be determined by taking sin x as the first function and ex the second function

In this section, we shall study what is called definite integral of a function
The definite integral has a unique value
A definite integral is denoted by ( )b af x dx, where a is called the lower limit of the integral and b is called the upper limit of the integral
The definite integral is introduced either as the limit of a sum or if it has an anti derivative F in the interval [ a, b], then its value is the difference between the values of F at the end points, i.e., F (b) – F(a)
7.8 Fundamental Theorem of Calculus 7.8.1 Area function We have defined ( )b af x dx as the area of the region bounded by the curve y = f(x), the ordinates x = a and x = b and x-axis
Let x be a given point in [ a, b]
Then ( )x af x dx represents the area of the light shaded region in Fig 7.1 [Here it is assumed that f(x) > 0 for x ∈ [a, b], the assertion made below is equally true for other functions as well]
The area of this shaded region depends upon the value of x
In other words, the area of this shaded region is a function of x
We denote this function of x by A(x)
We call the function A(x) as Area function and is given by A(x) =( )x af x dx ..
(1) Based on this definition, the two basic fundamental theorems have been given
However , we only state them as their proofs are beyond the scope of this text book
7.8.2 First fundamental theorem of integral calculus Theor em 1 Let f be a continuous function on the closed interval [ a, b] and let A (x) be the area function
Then A′ ′′ ′′(x) = f (x), for all x ∈ ∈∈ ∈∈ [a, b].Fig 7.1 7.8.3 Second fundamental theorem of integral calculus We state below an important theorem which enables us to evaluate definite integrals by making use of anti derivative
Theorem 2 Let f be continuous function defined on the closed interval [ a, b] and F be an anti derivative of f
Then ( )b af x dx = [F( )] =b ax F (b) – F( a)
Remarks (i)In words, the Theorem 2 tells us that ( )b af x dx= (value of the anti derivative F of f at the upper limit b – value of the same anti derivative at the lower limit a)
(ii) This theorem is very useful, because it gives us a method of calculating the definite integral more easily , without calculating the limit of a sum
(iii) The crucial operation in evaluating a definite integral is that of finding a function whose derivative is equal to the integrand
This strengthens the relationship between differentiation and integration
(iv) In ( )b af x dx, the function f needs to be well defined and continuous in [ a, b]
For instance, the consideration of definite integral 132 2 2( –1)x x dx - is erroneous since the function f expressed by f(x) = 1 2 2 ( –1)x x is not defined in a portion – 1 < x < 1 of the closed interval [– 2, 3]
Steps for calculating ( )b af x dx
(i)Find the indefinite integral ( )f x dx
Let this be F( x)
There is no need to keep integration constant C because if we consider F( x) + C instead of F( x), we get ( ) [F ( ) C] [F( ) C] – [F( ) C] F( ) – F( )bb aaf x dx x b a b a = + = + + =
Thus, the arbitrary constant disappears in evaluating the value of the definite integral
(ii) Evaluate F( b) – F( a) = [F ( )]b ax, which is the value of ( )b af x dx
We now consider some examples INTEGRALS 269 Example Evaluate the following integrals: (i) 2x dx (ii)9 3 4 ( – )xdx x (iii)2 1( 1) ( 2)x dx x x+ +(iv) 0sin 2 cos 2 t t dtπ 

One of the important methods for finding the indefinite integral is the method of substitution
To evaluate ( )b af x dx, by substitution, the steps could be as follows: 1.Consider the integral without limits and substitute, y = f(x) or x = g(y) to reduce the given integral to a known form
2.Integrate the new integrand with respect to the new variable without mentioning the constant of integration
3.Resubstitute for the new variable and write the answer in terms of the original variable
4.Find the values of answers obtained in (3) at the given limits of integral and find the difference of the values at the upper and lower limits
ANote In order to quicken this method, we can proceed as follows: After performing steps 1, and 2, there is no need of step 3
Here, the integral will be kept in the new variable itself, and the limits of the integral will accordingly be changed, so that we can perform the last step
Let us illustrate this by examples
Example Evaluate 5 1x x dx -+
Solution
Put t = x5 + 1, then dt = 5x4 dx
Therefore,4 1x x dx + = t dt = 3 3t = 3 5 ( 1)3x+ Hence, 5 1x x dx -+ = 5 2 – ( 1)3x  +      = ( )3 3 5 5 2 (1 1) – (– 1)   + +      =3 3 2 222   -      = 2 4 2(2 2)3 3= Alternatively , first we transform the integral and then evaluate the transformed integral with new limits
Let t =x5 + 1
Then dt = 5 x4 dx
Note that, when x =– 1, t = 0 and when x = 1, t = 2 Thus, as x varies from – 1 to 1, t varies from 0 to 2 Therefore 5 1x x dx -+ =2 0t dt = 3 3 2 2 2 – 3t    =             = 2 4 2(2 2)3 3= Example Evaluate – 2 0tan 1xdx x+ INTEGRALS 273

The new limits are, when x = 0, t = 0 and when x = 1, 4tπ=

Some Properties of Definite Integrals We list below some important properties of definite integrals
These will be useful in evaluating the definite integrals more easily
P0 : ( ) ( )b b a af x dx f t dt =  P1 : ( ) – ( )b a a bf x dx f x dx = 
In particular , ( ) 0a af x dx = P2 : ( ) ( ) ( )b c b a a cf x dx f x dx f x dx = +   P3 : ( ) ( )b b a af x dx f a b x dx = + -  P4 : 0 0( ) ( )a af x dx f a x dx = -  (Note that P4 is a particular case of P3) P5 :2 0 0 0( ) ( ) (2 )a a af x dx f x dx f a x dx = + -   P6 :2 0 0( ) 2 ( ) , if (2 ) ( )a af x dx f x dx f a x f x = - =  and 0 if f(2a – x) = – f(x) P7 :(i) 0( ) 2 ( )a a af x dx f x dx -= , if f is an even function, i.e., if f(– x) = f(x)
(ii) ( ) 0a af x dx -=, if f is an odd function, i.e., if f(– x) = – f(x)
We give the proofs of these properties one by one
Proof of P0 It follows directly by making the substitution x = t
Proof of P1 Let F be anti derivative of f
Then, by the second fundamental theorem of calculus, we have ( ) F ( ) – F ( ) – [F ( ) F ( )] ( )b a a bf x dx b a a b f x dx = = - = -  Here, we observe that, if a = b, then ( ) 0a af x dx =
Proof of P2 Let F be anti derivative of f
Then ( )b af x dx =F(b) – F( a) ..
(1) ( )c af x dx =F(c) – F( a) ..
(2) and ( )b cf x dx =F(b) – F( c) ..
(3) Adding (2) and (3), we get ( ) ( ) F( ) – F( ) ( )c b b a c af x dx f x dx b a f x dx + = =   This proves the property P2
Proof of P3 Let t = a + b – x
Then dt = – dx
When x = a, t = b and when x = b, t = a
Therefore ( )b af x dx = ( – )a bf a b t dt - + INTEGRALS 275 = ( – )b af a b t dt+ (by P1) = ( – )b af a b x+ dx by P0 Proof of P4 Put t = a – x
Then dt = – dx
When x = 0, t = a and when x = a, t = 0
Now proceed as in P3
Proof of P5 Using P2, we have 2 2 0 0( ) ( ) ( )a a a af x dx f x dx f x dx = +  
Let t =2a – x in the second integral on the right hand side
Then dt =– dx
When x = a, t = a and when x = 2a, t = 0
Also x = 2a – t
Therefore, the second integral becomes 2( )a af x dx =0– (2 – ) af a t dt = 0(2 – )af a t dt = 0(2 – )af a x dx Hence2 0( )af x dx =0 0( ) (2 )a af x dx f a x dx + -  Proof of P6 Using P5, we have 2 0 0 0( ) ( ) (2 )a a af x dx f x dx f a x dx = + -   ..
(1) Now , if f(2a – x) =f(x), then (1) becomes 2 0( )af x dx =0 0 0( ) ( ) 2 ( ) ,a a af x dx f x dx f x dx + =   and if f(2a – x) =– f(x), then (1) becomes 2 0( )af x dx = 0 0( ) ( ) 0a af x dx f x dx - =  Proof of P7 Using P2, we have ( )a af x dx - =0 0( ) ( )a af x dx f x dx -+ 
Then Let t =– x in the first integral on the right hand side
dt =– dx
When x = – a, t = a and when x =0, t = 0
Also x = – t
Therefore ( )a af x dx - =0 0– (– ) ( )a af t dt f x dx +  =0 0(– ) ( )a af x dx f x dx +  (by P0) ..
(1) (i)Now , if f is an even function, then f(–x) = f(x) and so (1) becomes 0 0 0( ) ( ) ( ) 2 ( )a a a a af x dx f x dx f x dx f x dx -= + =    (ii)If f is an odd function, then f(–x) = – f(x) and so (1) becomes 0 0( ) ( ) ( ) 0a a a af x dx f x dx f x dx -= - + =   Example Evaluate 1–x x dx -
Solution
We note that x3 – x ≥ 0 on [– 1, 0] and x3 – x ≤ 0 on [0, 1] and that x3 – x ≥ 0 on [1, 2]

When x = 0, t = 1 and when x = π, t = – 1
Therefore, (by P1) we get I =1 – 2 1dt t-π + = 1 212 1dt t-π + =1 201dt tπ + (by P7, since 1t+ is even function) =– 1 – 1 1 0tan tan 1 – tan 0 – 4t- π π    π = π = π =       Example Evaluate 4 1sin cosx x dx -

Let f(x) = sin5 x cos4 x
Then f(– x) = sin5 (– x) cos4 (– x) = – sin5 x cos4 x = – f(x), i.e., f is an odd function
Therefore, by P7 (ii), I = 0 Example Evaluate 4 2 4 4 0sin sin cosxdx x xπ +

In the differential calculus, we are given a function and we have to find the derivative or differential of this function, but in the integral calculus, we are to find a function whose differential is given
Thus, integration is a process which is the inverse of differentiation
Let F( ) ( )dx f xdx=
Then we write ( ) F ( ) Cf x dx x = +
These integrals are called indefinite integrals or general integrals, C is called constant of integration

If degree of the polynomial P(x) is greater than the degree of the polynomial Q(x), then we may divide P(x) by Q(x) so that 1P ( ) P( )T ( )Q( ) Q( )x xxx x= + , where T(x) is a polynomial in x and degree of P1(x) is less than the degree of Q(x)
T(x) being polynomial can be easily integrated
1P ( ) Q( )x x can be integrated by expressing 1P ( ) Q( )x x as the sum of partial fractions of the following type: 1

®Integration by substitution A change in the variable of integration often reduces an integral to one of the fundamental integrals
The method in which we change the variable to some other variable is called the method of substitution
When the integrand involves some trigonometric functions, we use some well known identities to find the integrals
Using substitution technique, we obtain the following standard integrals

®We have defined ( )b af x dx as the area of the region bounded by the curve y = f(x), a ≤ x ≤ b, the x-axis and the ordinates x = a and x = b
Let x be a INTEGRALS 291 given point in [ a, b]
Then ( )x af x dx represents the Area function A(x)
This concept of area function leads to the Fundamental Theorems of Integral Calculus
®First fundamental theorem of integral calculus Let the area function be defined by A(x) = ( )x af x dx for all x ≥ a, where the function f is assumed to be continuous on [ a, b]
Then A′(x) = f(x) for all x ∈ [a, b]
®Second fundamental theorem of integral calculus Let f be a continuous function of x defined on the closed interval [ a, b] and let F be another function such that F( ) ( )dx f xdx= for all x in the domain of f, then [ ] ( ) F( ) C F ( ) F ( )b b a af x dx x b a = + = -
This is called the definite integral of f over the range [ a, b], where a and b are called the limits of integration, a being the lower limit and b the upper limit
